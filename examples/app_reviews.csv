Tomb of the Mask,Overall fun game...but,1.6,2.0,"ENOUGH of the ads. I know the creator wants to make a buck, but this is INSANE! You have to watch an ad after Every Single Attempt. And to make matters worse, the ads are ridiculously repetitive. Game play is cool. Neat game.",0.0
Tomb of the Mask,Would be good if not for the ads,1.6,1.0,"Everything you do requires an ad, it’s really annoying. $8 a week for this game without having to watch ads or use energy? That’s absurd. I could see buying this game for maybe $3, but paying $8 A WEEK is crazy. This isn’t Netflix or a gym membership. It’s a mobile game, get out of here with your subscription model.",0.0

Tomb of the Mask,So many ads,1.6,4.0,The game itself is really fun but you go through two ads to start and one every single time you pass a level or fail a level. I understand it’s how they make money and how it keeps the game free. It just gets annoying after a while.,0.0
Tomb of the Mask,Terrible app,1.6,1.0,"This app has a cool game in it. However the app consists of ads every time you pass a level, fail at a level, open the app, and when ever else they want to put an ad in. You play for 15-30 seconds and then watch an ad that’s just as long. This ruined the game",0.0
Tomb of the Mask,Why so many ads?,1.6,4.0,So I personally think that why is there so many ads? How about every time an add shows up we should get coins or a free spin on the fortune wheel. But besides the ads the app is really great! That’s the only thing,0.0

Tomb of the Mask,Great gameplay buried under a pile of annoyances,1.6,2.0,"The actual game here is great. It's very satisfying to play, has a fun art style, and contains a fun mix of puzzle game and fast paced arcade game. However trying to play this game is a chore. You only have 5 lives that take a long time to recharge, you have to watch ads to open chests, continue a level if you die, and after every game unless you pay to remove them. But even paying the few bucks to remove ads doesn't remove the ads to open chests or revive in a level. If you want access to all of the masks, unlimited lives, and a few free coins, it's going to cost you $8 a WEEK. That's insane for a mobile game this simple. I wouldn't even pay $8 to own this game once and they are expecting that weekly to make their game fully playable.

There’s a lot of paid games out there that can’t beat this! I’m specifically writing this review to note that there is a glitch in stage 93. My girlfriend and I have both encountered it. I thing she managed to bypass it somehow, but I haven’t figured out how yet. Basically, after going through one of the teleporting gateways, it pushes you into the wall, eventually allowing you to actually escape the map. Fun glitch, but it doesn’t actually seem easily avoidable. Maybe I’ll solve it, but the glitch still exists.

Tomb of the Mask,"Great, few concerns",1.6,4.0,"The game is very fun and addictive. At first, it’s very slow at getting coins other than the wheel you receive for free every few hours. I absolutely love this game, but I have 2 “major” concerns:

1) Firstly, upon loading the game, in net with a screen talking about the weekly subscription (Unlimited energy, 400 coins per day, no ads and some masks). Sounds interesting and helpful, right? Well, they give you 3 days for free, but then it’s $7.99 per WEEK. Personally, I feel that is very expensive for a single week and I may purchase it if it does lower in price.

2) Secondly, I think it was a great option to have a “free” and “paid” option to regenerate a second life per level. I tend to go for the free option, only taking about 30 seconds and returning to the level. But, more than half of the time, the ad doesn’t even work and I’m forced to close the app, restart the level and wasting an energy. I know many will say/think “Well, it must be your internet!” when it’s not. When I do complete the level, yet another ad comes up and it perfectly shows.",0.0

Tomb of the Mask,Its good... up until a point,1.6,4.0,"Look dont get me wrong this game has me addicted and ive been playing like crazy, but there are some big problems,

•Advertising- Nowadays you cant get a game without those annoying ads, but some games limit their ad use to a minimum, tomb of the mask is not one of those games. Im getting an ad after every attempt of a level no matter if i win or not, which is crazy annoying (especially when its the same ad) I would suggest doing an ad maybe only when you die in the game, or just give an ad for every 3 plays.

•Gameplay- The gameplay is fantastic for tomb of the mask until a certain point, Ive gotten to about level 43 and have been introduced to a new obstacle, an odd Chinese dragon that runs a horizontal line though the track which kills you if you touch it. The problem with this obstacle is you have to be super observant if you actually want to see this coming because the only warning is one block blinking for about 2 seconds. This has killed me so many times just because I didnt see it coming.

• In-App purchases- Ok wow, Tomb of the Mask went crazy on in app purchases. Do you want no ads? Here pay $1 so you can have your sanity. Do you want actually good upgrades for you character, here pay this subscription for a couple masks, what about the ability to not have to wait 2 and a half hours for you energy to recharge, boom subscribe to our mobile game. The in app purchases make the game so hard so enjoy. The energy system that restricts gameplay is put it for the sole fact of making you want the subscription or wanting to use all your money to refill. All you have to do is just cut the recharge time in half so the subscription still has use but doesn't punish the kids who want to save their allowance.

For the most part, the levels are challenging enough and it seems to me that a lot of thought went into making the game. I only have a few things that I think could be better. First, I would love it if the energy had a larger maximum capacity or replenished faster. I would even be satisfied if I could buy upgrades like that with coins. Also, the levels are really fun and interesting, but some of the later ones just seem much shorter and easier than they should be. I just wish they’d add a little something to the post 100 levels to make them more enjoyable and less of a colorful pixelated scavenger hunt. For example, I loved that little rolling ball that follows you and I would like more of it. It’s a shame the late levels don’t have as much effort put into them as late stages in arcade.

And the fact that they want you to pay $8 a week to remove those advertisements is asinine and frankly, insulting. It is designed like an old-school arcade game, but the designers have 0 pride in it. They certainly did not make this game as a way to provide others with enjoyment— it is simply a money grab. You will have fun with this game.

Good grief that’s $32/month! Further each time you load up after that you are presented with another ad just before you are offered the same in app purchase as before. so every time you load up that’s two ads before you even get to the menus to play the game. Next after most any level failure or any arcade death if you choose to continue or not (unless you use coins) you have to watch an ad. Holy crap you spend just as much time watching and viewing ads as you do playing the game. Naturally the game does offer a remove ads in app purchase for $3, though Ive paid less for better games. Unless you are willing to at least spend the $3 on the remove ads, this games not worth the download. As said cash grab app.",0.0

If it was 2 or 5 you could play the game more consistently but if u die 5 times its over, your stuck playing arcade till u ether have 1000 coins wich is ridiculously high compared with the masks or wait 20 long, boring minutes if u have nothing to do. And the ads just add insult to injury. But if your tired of ads or wait times you could buy a premium wich comes with a bunch of pixels shaped into four masks, no ads, and unlimited energy for a high price of 8 dollars a WEEK. Not monthly, WEEKLY. With all the flaws this game has i won't be surprised if the masks disappear once your premium runs out... one things for sure, once they fix all the flaws of this game there will be a even better game with little to no flaws

Tomb of the Mask,Awesome game but...,1.6,2.0,"Way to many adds. It’s insane, are all the new “free” games on the App Store like this now?

Tomb of the Mask,Love it,1.6,5.0,"I really love this game and it’s concept. I also like that levels are quick so it doesn’t take too long. But one thing I dislike is the energy thing, I have to wait 30 mins. for one energy! I have a suggestion maybe make a head to head mode, where it’s like arcade but you both go at once and whoever has the best Score wins. Overall great game! Hope to see more from this!",0.0

Tomb of the Mask,No thanks,1.6,1.0,"This used to be an incredibly fun endless arcade game to get lost in. Then there was this interesting addition of levels to play, which included some weird energy timer. That’s when things took a turn for the worst. I specifically re-downloaded the game to make sure I was still accurate. Now this old hidden gem is a crap storm of pop up ads, banner ads, and some bs $8 a month charge. Are you serious? You have become no different than other large companies who take advantage of their consumers to make money. You lost a real promoter and fan of your work. What you’ve become is a huge problem for me. Oh and your game has a had a bug for as long as I can remember where I have 44 shields and am completely unable to use them in arcade or the leveled mode by double tapping or even tapping on the icon on the screen. I’m never going to download this game again, so do whatever you want with this information and enjoy your creation for whatever it is worth to you.",0.0

Well I got up to the 40s or 50s and...it happened again. Not sure what the issue is, every other app on my phone is fine, I’m connected to the internet. It just won’t load.

Tomb of the Mask,"Would you like to watch an ad? No, ok watch an ad.",1.6,2.0,"This game has good game play.

Tomb of the Mask,"Good game, but...",1.6,4.0,"This is amazingly well thought out game, however the energy system is horrible. I am only on level 9 and am already out of energy. The way energy SHOULD be used is that to use a shield you use energy, not that you use energy when you die, as this limits gameplay. Also, the traps should be slightly a different color than the floor making them more visible, as this is how many people die, wich, back on the subject of energy, limits gameplay time. Overall good game! 4/5",0.0
Tomb of the Mask,$35 per month? Disgusting.,1.6,1.0,"I love the game. The game itself is fine, let me just say that upfront. The problem I have with it, however, is that every time it is open, it prompts me to subscribe to a “diamond membership”. The subscription ask as soon as I started the game was already a turn off, but then I saw that this subscription is $7.99 per WEEK. That adds up to $35 per month, or $416 per year.

That said, I’d love to make two changes:
First, like every single other review, fewer ads would make the game better. I’d probably play longer and see more ads in total. 
Second, the controls are too sensitive. I frequently die because my swipe right registered as down for some reason. Especially difficult on parts where you’re being chased or have to move fast. I also waste a lot of shields because it thinks I’m double-tapping when I’m really just swiping fast.

Tomb of the Mask,Fun but some concerns,1.6,3.0,I like the concept of the game it’s fun and challenging but whenever I finish a level (which doesn’t take long for me) an ad appears. Then I die an ad appears again I like the game just the ads everywhere is what annoys me and the fact you need to lay 8 dollars for MASKS A WEEK I’m ok with ads sprinkled here and there but every time you die or finish a short level is too much,0.0
Tomb of the Mask,To many ads,1.6,2.0,"Every time I play this game I get an ad in my face for every level I pass or if I lose and try to play the game again I have to watch an ad. This game is actually really fun, and I would give it 5 stars but there is to many ads. I’m also not going to waste my money on some game that’s literally 8 dollars a week. Most of the time I can’t even skip the ads so I exit the app and go back into the game. And when you swipe, it doesn’t go the right way, especially in arcade mode. The only thing I ask is for less ads, it would be so much better and maybe more people would get this game (I don’t know, just a thought lol)",0.0
Tomb of the Mask,Game is great...,1.6,3.0,"The game itself is great, I see almost nothing wrong with it. But let me ask you this. What do you see more, ads or the game itself? After every time you die or start a level, there is a thirty second ad. Please at least remove some of the ads, because no one is going to pay $7.99 a week.

Tomb of the Mask,"Used to be good, now too many ads",1.6,1.0,"Honestly I lived this game when it first came out. I deleted it after completing everything a while back but decided to try it again when I saw it trending. Now it plays 2 video ads between every level, and another 2 video ads if you die/need to restart. Horrendous, making the free version unplayable so people are forced to buy. If you want to make money just put a price on the app upfront. I'd have been willing to pay 2$ for it to own, but now I'm just so disappointed in the developers.",0.0

Tomb of the Mask,Best mobile game ever,1.5.2,5.0,"Hands down best mobile game I’ve ever played. It strikes the perfect balance between games you can quickly pick up and play and games with some real depth and content. In an era where hyper casual is dominating the market this game offers a breath of fresh air and breaks the mold from other games in the genre. There is some real depth and thought and challenge to this game that is unmatched. I’m rating the game 5 stars for the amazing and addictive gameplay. Overall the game is not without its flaws like the annoying music and SFx but I just mute the audio. Also, the ads are a nightmare. An ad after everything you see or do. And a subscription model to remove ads? These guys sure know how to make money. If it was any other game I’d have deleted it by now without a standard option to remove ads for $$0.99 or something, but because the core gameplay is so good I still rate it 5 stars. Don’t rate a game bad simply cause it has an annoying monetary system. Rate a game for what the game is and if you do that then this deserves 5 stars. Thanks devs for putting in the effort to make something truly great!",0.0
Tomb of the Mask,Potential for greatness,1.5.2,2.0,"This gameplay and level style is really creative and fun to play. However, the experience is RUINED by a cluttered app full of ads. Literally to finish a level you have to watch a video, to move on to the next level you have to watch a video, and you have to see another add if you want to replay a level after dying. On top of that, you have five lives for every few hours, or you can watch a 30 second video for a free revive. So when it comes down to it I’m spending much more time watching ads than playing the game. Oh, but not to worry. You can play the premium ad free version for $8 a f*****g WEEK! What kind of subscription for a free game is that?! It’s so sad to see an amazing game destroyed by a stupid cash grab. I think this game would make more money off of a $2 one time payment, because nobody in their right mind would pay that much.",0.0

Almost every level you pass there’s an add at the end or beginning of the next level. It’s a fun game to play, but it’s annoying when you have an add for everything you do. Plus there’s a new add that keeps crashing the app. That would be nice if you got rid of it.

Tomb of the Mask,Amazing Concept - Poor Execution,1.5.2,2.0,"First thing: There is a ton of ads and money grabbing shoved down your throat at all points in this game. 

For example, one of the first things you’ll see when you start up the game is a full yellow page advocating you to purchase VIP. For $8.99 a WEEK. Yeah. A week. My Netflix subscription is less money than that. Basically any subscription is less than that. Do NOT buy the VIP upgrade. 

They really have gone too far with the ads and money grabbing. You have the basic stuff like watch an ad for energy, chests, etc... then you have the ads after every level wether you win or lose; you have ads when you click X number of buttons; you have an ad bar at the bottom of the game at all times. It’s honestly a little game ruining for me. I love the concept of this game so much. I played a demo in another game as an ad and immediately wanted to get the full app. 

The art style is interesting and new for me. This type of game isn’t something I normally play so it’s a nice change. I would really love to fully enjoy this game without having to pay $2.99 to remove ads and still have all the other Pay to Win bs. Or pay $8.99 every stinkin week. 

Another complaint I have is the energy. 5 MAX energy.. really? But wait! You can just purchase VIP and get unlimited energy! No thanks.

And to make matters worse, the free version is littered with ads akin to a mad men-Esqué minesweeper.

Tomb of the Mask,"Way, way, WAY too many ads.",1.5.2,3.0,"Don’t misunderstand me, the game is pretty good, seems polished and it’s very entertaining.
A few important criticisms:
First, the map looks like a sideways never ending snake, and the game is represented as a tower in the ads and in the start screen, so it would make sense to make it go up, instead of sideways. Also, you should make it look more interesting with dungeons, special levels or something like that. 
Second, the most important part: the are WAY too many ads. One when you finish a map level, one when you finish an arcade level, and when you open the game (two in that case). Also, there’s a constant banner on the lower side of the screen. 
These guys must be making a lot. I think I’ve seen more than 70 adds from this game, just this day.
Also, the subscription doesn’t add too much to the gameplay, is constantly shoved to your face, and costs a lot of money. 

So, overall, the game is quite good, and I’d like to give it 5 stars, but those ads are a BIG problem. Hope you fix this in the future.

Oh and also the controls are terrible and don’t function right. You double tap to get a shield (which costs money) and you swipe to move. They made it so it’s easier for you to double tap than it is to swipe. And if you don’t mind the bombardment of unskippable ads, then too bad because you need energy to play a level. Yup.

Tomb of the Mask,"Great game, ruined by a few things.",1.6,4.0,"This game is actually really good. The game has pleasing visuals and the levels are cleverly designed. The amount of work put into this game is reflected by the finished product. However, I will not hesitate to complain. 

Firstly, ads. Yes, it has been mentioned in reviews quite a lot, but the amount of adverts in this game is unreal. Whilst the game is free and ads are expected, ads every time you lose a game is too much. Not only that, but there are also ads at the bottom of the screen whilst you play a level, distracting you from the actual gameplay. Therefore, I was forced to play with Wi-Fi turned off which I hate doing since it’s cutting off the money supply of the developers. One ad every couple of ended games would be better, but if the developers did what Crossy Road did (where ads are optional and you have to actually press an action to get the ads and a reward) that would be so much better. 

You can remove the ads however through a £2.99 one time payment, but considering that other developers give this option for only £0.99, it seems a bit too much. 

On the other hand, you can choose to get a subscription with multiple rewards that costs £6.99 per week. That is super expensive, amounting to almost £360 per year. Now, these sort of games come and go so I doubt anybody would keep a subscription for that long as they’d get bored of the game within a month or so (hence the large price of the subscription), therefore I’d like to be a bit different and give the developers a pass on this one. However, even a slight drop of price on both the subscription and one time payment would be appreciated. 

The game also has energy levels, something I would associate with mediocre games, but with this game, it made sure I didn’t play too much and hence get bored of the game. But also, they could be used to get you more hooked on the game by playing little by little each day, making this a daily habit (and more likely to pay the membership), but once you pay the subscription to get rid of the energy levels, the developers wouldn’t really care about that anymore as the whole point of it was to get you to pay up. I wouldn’t like to be so cynical though. 

On final remarks, I appreciate this game’s usage of the latest features like the Taptic Engine and optimisation of the iPhone X’s display. Don’t get me wrong, this is a really good game and the positives really outweigh the negatives. But please listen to the feedback, Playgendary. That would be much appreciated.

However, the game is ruined by one thing. This game is littered with ads. I literally cannot end a level or play the wheel of fortune without an ad playing before or after. I’ve heard that even getting ad block doesn’t help. And the worst part is that you can’t skip them, you have to watch them through to the end.

Also the shield, sometimes I don’t even mean to activate it and I just waste it on a easy level so that’s not right. But lovely game just try and ease it on the ads and make sure you need to press a button to get a shield instead of double tapping because somehow I activate it while I play by accident.",0.0

Tomb of the Mask,Great game ruined by forced ads.,1.5.1,3.0,"This is a very fun, addictive and satisfying game, I would have given it more stars if the whole experience with the game wasn’t completely ruined by the constant forcing of advertisements. There where times when I would fail the level because the app hadn’t finished loading in the ad banner at the bottom of the screen and stuttered and lagged. When you fail, or win, you can watch an add for a free life or spin on their wheel, but if you fancy just getting back to the game or trying the next level, too bad, here’s a unskipable advertisement, only this time you don’t get anything out of it. Plus, it’s a sorry state of things when I’m spending more time being force fed adverts than I am on the actual levels. Ads welcome you before the title screen does as well! I would have much preferred spending £10 for the complete game, but unfortunately there is much more profit in ad revenue and micro transactions, even if it ruins a perfectly good game.",3.0

However this game is marred by its insane amount of ads on the free version. After every success and fail, Oop! Another ad in your face for another game that you don’t really care about! 
This is made more annoying by the fact that you can remove the constant ads, but only if you Subscribe for £6.99 per week. PER WEEK! They are asking for £27.98 per month! In less than two months you’d already be paying the same price for a console triple A game..

Consistently I have found myself swiping in a particular direction only to be sent flying the complete opposite way, almost as if the slightest nudge in a different direction to my inputted command somehow overrides all previous decisions I’ve ever made. This leads to an immediate death in most circumstances, presenting you with another pay for life screen. 

Amongst this, you will have to pay for energy, watch ads to gain revenue for the game creators and also pay for their premium membership which is advertised to you every 3 nanoseconds, even if you close the advert using the provided cross, there’s no guarantee that this will indeed close the ad, and you may have to wait for longer until the game creators decide that it’s time to remove the ad because the constant barraging is not going to make you pay £5 for new masks.

Overall this game had potential to make history on the App Store as one of the few semi-original concepts with perfect execution. However, when the creators spend more time placing focus into how many ads can be shown in a 2 minute window and draining your wallet dry for lives, the core gameplay suffers and it is evident here in waves.",0.0
Tomb of the Mask,A Standard Review,1.4,2.0,"The game itself is good. Tight controls, nice simplistic visuals, a good feel and overall well planned puzzles. Yes it is littered with the amount of ad’s you’d expect to find in a freemium game. However. If you get tired of running out of energy (basically the life system of the game) it offers you ‘diamond membership’ que flashy lights and confetti. The price for this membership is £6.99. Per. Week. This adds up to around £27 per month, the price of your average second hand triple X title after a few months. The average price of a phone contract or home internet direct debit. For an IPhone app. This to me is the most overpriced thing since the US defence budget. For this sin and this sin alone it receives a measly two stars. To you developers I say shame. Shame on you, a plague upon your houses. Go and think about what you’ve done.",3.0
Tomb of the Mask,Too many adverts,1.4,1.0,I’m all for supporting games and I most likely will buy the full version to support the developer especially if the game is good. But honesty there are far too many adverts for me to even get into the game. After you do anything the game plays and advert. I played the game around 15 mins and was shown properly 25 adverts in that time. Far too much which made me delete the game not even able to enjoy it which is a real shame.,0.0

Tomb of the Mask,Rotten With In-App Ads,1.3,2.0,I understand devs need to make a living but this model is awful. Flat-out stopping you from playing the game until you pay or wait 20 minutes for “energy to recharge”. I paid to “remove ads” but this doesn’t seem to affect ads when the app launches and all the other systems in place make it impossible to play the game. I remember playing this when it came out and loved it but all these systems going on stop me from even “getting into” it any more. I also find the controls a lot laggier than I remembered. The game picking up a lot of false inputs on my iPhone X. Very frustrating to lose a run due to poor controls.,0.0
Tomb of the Mask,Disgusting new monetisation system,1.3,1.0,"Upon updating to the latest version, I was greeted with a an option subscribe to a £6.99 auto-renewing WEEKLY charge for unlimited energy and no ads.

Tomb of the Mask,Feel like I've been scammed,1.2.27,2.0,"I paid the £0.99 fee to remove ads, but still get pop up ads when I open the app. 

Gameplay is fun and addictive but the energy system ruins it in my opinion. If I die 5 times I have to wait a considerable amount of time before I can play again. An easy way fix to this would just be to scrap that system all together. The game would would be so much more fun if you could instantly respawn at the start of the level and try again. Also, this would also make the game much easier to play on the go

I don’t like the ad system, way too reliant on that now (even though the game wasn’t always like that).

But the biggest annoyance for me is the stubbornness of the devs to refuse support for iCloud saving. I spent a long time playing this, got all the masks, then bought a new phone. I didn’t want to reinstall all my apps, but wanted to start a fresh. I’d asked the devs before if they would be supporting iCloud saves & the answer was basically a no, and we never will.

Short, tricky tests for your brain and reflexes which fill just enough time for when you are waiting for that bus or friend who's always late.

The simplicity of the pixel style graphics does not detract from the beauty of the visuals, with the graphics having a definite upgrade when the level system was introduced (kudos to the developer for that).

Please don't sue me it's just for my uni project. I stopped watching adds since it's only 300 coins for the ad. I used to watch them religiously. I feel like movement mechanics are a wee bit worse, like I accidentally go where I didn't intend to. And last but not least I think this game would be a lot better with some simpler mechanics allowing player to stay longer in a game. Then I would be more willing to pay for an in-app content. And screw it: why not give 5mln coins for £5? It's £5! That's a lot for a app but still you'd get only 30k coins? That doesn't seem fare. But I'm just a student I don't know much about merchandising just yet. All in all the programmers did a great job, graphics is amazing but I'd rather see it going crazier and bolder. But maybe then it wouldn't become an editors choice? I don't know. Anyway keep up the good work guys!",0.0

There is an option to revive for a certain amount of coins (500), or to watch a video. I am not sure if this hanged the further on you get, as I have not progressed too far within the game as of yet. There is a shop feature, which allows you to buy new masks, which is your character, with the coins you collect within game. There is also a prize wheel which is like a lucky dip. You pay 200 coins, and receive on the the prices from the wheel, such as some coins. I would recommend this game to anyone interested in the endless genre, or retro feeling games.

I would appreciate if you made the levels much harder to beat because I find them unchallenging. Here’s why: when you updated the game and added more levels, I have beaten each one of those levels under an hour (literally) and didn’t really give me the feel of a harder aspect of a higher level. Also could you possibly make the levels increase in difficulty always because when I was beating the final levels I realize that levels 190 - 195 were much easier that levels 185 - 189 which to me doesn’t make sense, since levels 190 - 195 are higher they should be more difficult than 185 - 289.

I would really appreciate someone helping me get it back, because otherwise I'm not playing through all that again, I collected every single dot and star too and had quite a few characters.

Tomb of the Mask,Not worth it.,1.5.1,1.0,"I get that you have to have ads in an app to get revenue, but when you play they game and 70% of your time is spent waiting for ads to finish, it’s not worth it.

Tomb of the Mask,TOO MANY ADS,1.5.1,1.0,"- There is an ad when you open the game.
- After every level
- Everytime you restart a level
- That giant button at the end that you will press it cuz it’s made for it. 😒 Nicely placed when you just wanna play the next level and click fast on your screen.

Boring and if you play your child will not listen to you they won’t do anything except play on that game",0.0
Tomb of the Mask,Game doesn't want to be played,1.5.1,3.0,"This game's greatest asset is the gameplay itself. It's straightforward, satisfying, responsive, and visually pleasing with a concrete aesthetic. Unfortunately, it seems to be designed to let you experience the actual gameplay as infrequently as possible.

The first problem is that the game is riddled with ads. They appear constantly, in between what seems like every single menu interaction. But Airplane Mode effectively solves this problem, even if you can't claim the free chests while offline.

Extraneous menu navigation is another problem. If you happen to die in the game, you have to navigate through no less than three menus, sometimes taking upwards of 1 minute because of ads, just to attempt the level again. It's something that severely messes with the normally fast-paced gameplay experience. A quick “Retry” button on the Revive screen would be extremely beneficial.

The game's final shortcoming is the presence of a seemingly useless “Energy” system that limits for how long you can actually play the game. Typically, this mechanic is used in collectible-type games, multiplayer games, or in some other game to discourage significant grinding. It doesn't really belong in this kind of game with many levels and quick gameplay. Obviously, this game implements this in order to push for microtransactions just to be able to play the game for more than a few minutes at a time. It's a disappointment, and I guarantee that nobody would complain if it were removed entirely.

Above all, the gameplay is charming and interesting, but is irredeemably held back by bad UI and predatory money-grubbing practices. It's a shame, because I would easily pay a fair amount up-front for this game without ads or unnecessary limitations.",0.0

The sounds are interesting, the arcade mode is nearly perfect (nearly), and it’s got the makings of a great classic for a large fan base.

The bad: First off, this is an extremely buggy game. It’s highly unresponsive to finger swipes, and when it is responsive, it’s a step behind. Nearly all of my deaths on stages is caused by my guy going backwards instead of forwards when I clearly swiped forward. From what I’ve gathered, this may be due to a (recent?) update, but this needs to be fixed. Second, the number of ads is absolutely ridiculous. There is absolutely NO reason to require watching an ad after EVERY single stage. I realize that they are your sponsors and they pay you to play these ads, but the more times you play those ads, the more infuriated I get and definitely the LESS inclined I am to support them, or you. Less ads played. Not “no ads played,” but less. Third, the Energy system is also ridiculous. I shouldn’t have to pay for lives, and certainly not only FIVE at a time. Either the Energy system needs to be abolished altogether (this is what should happen), or increase it and remove the waiting period. I understand watching ads to replenish them, but waiting for them if I don’t want to watch ads is still ridiculous. I’m more likely to delete the game in that waiting period then I am to support it. We don’t mind ads, but we DO mind LOTS of them. Tone it down.

Again, COULD be a great app, and I would consider paying to support it further, but not until it’s more worthy to do so.",0.0

Tomb of the Mask,This game WAS worth 6 stars.,1.2.21,3.0,";/ It’s half the game it used to be. It’s been a year since the big bad update, which altered the masterpiece for the worse. It added a whole new facet to the game with 60+ (fun) levels, sure, but it’s still less than what it was!

First off, I’m noticing many new bugs in it. So often now the game doesn’t respond to my finger swipe, so when my eyes are looking up ahead I fail to notice my character is going back the other way because it’s behind a step, this is very VERY frustrating. 90% of my deaths now are because of this one bug. It used to be smooth and responsive before that update, now my girlfriend wonders why I’m still putting myself through this..

We used to be able to bring our shields up to 99, which was great for long treks, now it only goes up to 10 shields, which activate WAY too easily, and because of that they’re all gone by accident before you know it. There is no way in hell I will ever beat my best score now :| :( :C

Happymagenta created a true classic here, but then they ‘intentionally’ worsened it for some odd reason. I’m still so vexed with this question to them, “Why did you try and ‘fix’ something that was already so perfect!?!” At least release the original arcade version as a stand-alone, please guys!",3.0

Energy/lives should be less of a wait for, especially when the cap is 5 and is such a fast paced level system game. Easy to ""rig""/play your odds in favour of getting coins from the wheel and doubling by ads (ad limit should be put in?) I'm finding myself lost in some levels as its very fast paced but cant really ""see ahead"". Maybe a mini map of sorts would help (obviously not giving away where traps and foes are, but gives the player a rough idea of whats the path is like in the sense of a compass.

Good stuff:
Very fast paced and addicting, I find myself itching to continue to the next level and getting so involved that when I die, I want to throw my brand new phone across the room (in a good way). Like the power ups, but maybe a levelling system for them would be cool rather then a buy and use and re-buy again system.

Don't get me wrong- this is still a great game. It hasn't really gone down in quality. Yet. Every patch strays closer and closer to dangerous ""bad free to play app store game"" territory and I hope that it doesn't continue that way. The most recent update adds a ""story mode"", but this mode has a typical energy live system. You can no longer stack wheel of fortune free spins. The wheel of fortune itself is much worse and there's basically no reason to pay gold to use it now. Ads are starting to be encroached more upon the player- watch an ad to do this. Watch an ad to get this bonus. More and more we're being pushed into this, and I hope it doesn't get to a state of it being an app that I delete off my phone.

Tomb of the Mask,Why⁉️,1.0,2.0,"Why all the good reviews on this? Honestly I don't get it. It's charming, it reminds me of a Colecovision game, sort of. The sounds and visuals at least. But that's all. The gameplay is lacking. You can't really control where you want to go, like going half way between two walls. Swipe up or down or whatever and you don't stop till you hit something, and once you die, it's back to the beginning unless you want to ""watch an ad"". Really? Lame. So basically you see how far you can go each time, and it gets boring after about 5 minutes. Dear developers; Please check out the Colecovision game ""Mouse Trap"". Make that, it has a similar feel (sort of) but it's a million times more fun. 👌",0.0

I just don't like games with ads... I would prefer to just be required to pay upfront for an ad free experience because when given the choice, I won't put money into a game that I can play for free unless I know I'm going to keep playing it for some time, and ads take a lot away from the enjoyable experience of a game. I think a better method to enhance user experience would be to offer a timed trial of the game for free and then if after that amount of time the user still wants to play the game they must pay for it - so people who like the game will pay for it and be happy; there won't exist any users that like the game and yet are unhappy due to ads. It just takes ads out of the equation.",0.0

Tomb of the Mask,Game time vs Ad time,1.5.1,1.0,"I played the first 7 or 8 levels before deleting the game. From my experience, there’s ads after every level, and forced 30s ads for a chest opening. Time spent playing vs watching ads was probably close to 35:65 which is a huuuge turn-off. 
Gameplay was fun but the ads were a dealbreaker. 
The devs clearly want to generate a revenue but over saturation of ads means a decent chunk of people will stop playing the game earlier so ultimately you condemn your game.

Tomb of the Mask,Are you for real?,1.4,1.0,This game could be so much fun yet i am slammed with ad’s everywhere. the game has such simple and good looking graphics but is ruined by ad’s everywhere not to mention it forcing you to watch ad’s.

This game just updated today. According to the release notes the update contains “minor performance and stability improvements”.
That is a total lie.

What the update actually does is kill the game’s framerate and add pop-up ads when you start the game and add video ads after every level - even if you’ve paid money to disable them.

WARNING: If you are installing this game for the first time, the controls were slower than before but still a great arcade game.

Tomb of the Mask,Change how camera moves back to old version,1.2.1,2.0,The camera feels really weird and slow because of the smoothing you've put on it. It was better before or if you like it at least include an option for both types of cameras. Other than that everything else is pretty good.,0.0

Tomb of the Mask,WARNING DO NOT UPDATE!,1.2.1,1.0,"TOTM is a great game and I have had since release, but since the new update I lost ALL my progress! So if you are new to the game, download it, but if you are an old player DO NOT UPDATE!!!!",1.0
Tomb of the Mask,I Agree with other comment...,1.2.1,4.0,"Tomb of the Mask is one of my favorite endless maze games to break out and play when I am looking for something to do. Everything from the character pixel art to the game audio has been carefully crafted and I am very grateful for the attention to detail they have taken when creating this game!
But... Since this new update with an impressive second option to play, I have noticed the character controls feel kind of 'slow'. Where before I used to make small finger gestures and swipes to move the character strategically around the screen, I must now succumb to slight screen lag, with occasional mis-press triggering an unwanted shield. I hope you are able to fix this compatibility issue, I must assume comes from using an older model iPhone (5c).

Such cool games but they rush you through everything just to flood you with ads and some you can’t even click through until you played some of it. 

Sure, you can download their “no ads” by downloading an entirely new app...because that’s the way it works right? Nah, it doesn’t, but they make you anyway. Be careful my friends before these apps mess you up. Be wise on your finger clicks and DO NOT EXPECT IT TO BE LIKE A BROWSER .io game.",0.0

Bumper.io,Fun game,1.2.0,4.0,"I enjoyed this game immensely and I would recommend it (which I have already done) to anyone, with the exception of people who just don’t like this style of game. I would definitely rate this game five out of five stars if it had these two suggestions added to it. 
     1. Have more tiers that progressively get harder to get to and you need more wins to level up. This would make the game more difficult and fun because after a week of playing this game I reached master 1 and then I just didn’t have any objective to keep playing for. I considered deleting the app because of the fact that I no longer had a goal or a motivator to play. I just think it would make this game a lot more fun and it would keep players better. 
     2. So anyone who has played the game hole.io probably remembers one of the best features that was a little glitchy but still made the game worth playing. This feature was the ability to play with other devices in your own match so that you could play with your friends. I think that this game should have that feature because it would make it so much more fun and entertaining if this was integrated well (without all of the glitches I experienced in hole.io) into the game. I think this is a great game with a lot of potential for great fun and I think it would be even better with the things I said earlier. Thank you for your time!",0.0

I understand the need of adds when it comes to free games but a lot of game makers make the mistake of putting in too many. Some games I have downloaded in the past have no adds unless you want to revive, and they were free. Others such as this one put in way to much adds making it almost impossible to really enjoy the game. after a while you do get used to it, but it still isn’t fun watching so many adds.

Bumper.io,Awful Game Mechanics,1.2.0,2.0,"The mechanics for this game are both confusing and completely worthless. Since you need to constantly be moving and turning, you’re constantly charging your rush move. This is fine, until you lift your finger off in the slightest and you go flying off on the other side of the map. Furthermore, the AI bots are almost impossible to knock off compare to the player. If the player is hanging off the edge even a little bit, you fall off and can’t recover. This would be fine if it was the same case for bots, but if you don’t land a freaking “home run” hit every single time, the bots just slowly pace themselves back into the arena.

However, this game could be greatly improved with just one minor improvement: real life players. Every IO game has real life players from across the globe. Although this game pretends to do this by generating a handful of fake usernames, I was not fooled. Although IO games are slightly more fun with real life players, it’s still an ok game. It’s the choice of generated usernames that I don’t like. Many of them are EXTREMELY inappropriate, such as the player that beat me in the last game I played dubbed “dovakindupenis”.

It’s a great game to play if you’re angry or stressed because you get to knock other bumper cars into the water. I suggest getting this game!

This game is fun to play but it really needs more updates on gameplay and not more levels. You should have a Shop system or more Ranks. Once you reach Master1 which I have, and you keep playing the Maxed Out difficulty of AI it gets boring not having a goal once you reach Master1.

First of all they need to fix the rubber banding, once your big, they will come after you and will go for you only.

Next it needs more levels, I know they’re consistently making more, but they don’t make many. But great stage designs tho

They also need an online mode, do you know how cool it would be to play against your friends and others around the globe this is something that lets the game down ALOT, playing offline is cool and all, I don’t use my data when offline, but it’s just missing something that would make it much better 

Skins should also be added

And I have noticed that this game uses bots  which makes the game really easy and that makes the game boring and not worth playing. You could put in an online mode and offline mode, where online you play against real people and when you play offline you play against bots.

Some things that I would say would make the game a whole lot better and ensure my 5 star review:

*Give the option to choose whether to play against bots or not, maybe in the form of different game modes like seen in Hole.io.
*Have challenges, which can unlock aesthetics for your character.
*(Following from the last one) Introduce a point system which are collected from completed challenges and used to buy the aesthetics.

I hope to see these in future updates as they’d make this mediocre game a whole lot better.",0.0
Bumper.io,Great but....,1.1.8,5.0,"You should add local multiplayer or just multiplayer because it would be fun to (carry) your friends to master 1 like I am or just be able to play online would make everything less (brain dead) because playing offline is easy I mean people that are new to the game will find it hard especially when you get to gold 3 everything gets a lot harder but I am in master 1 and have been for a while now and I just want more reasons to play the game...

Bumper.io,The simplicity of it all,1.1.8,4.0,"It’s a good game, the controls are easy to master as is the game, maybe the game is too easy to be honest. 

I have read many reviews about adding hats and glasses etc etc I’m not sure your aware of the simplistic nature of io games, whilst it would be nice and somewhat amusing I don’t see how it would help in this game. Maybe different patterns for your car would be a more subtle approach.

The game is played by bots almost certainly  but I can’t see where it says or guarantees we play with other people from around the world, if it did it doesn’t now. You can tell it’s bots by changing app and then going back 20 seconds later, it’s been paused same amount of people are left and you haven’t been knocked off, if these were real players from around the world it would be game over, lost connection etc.

Overall it’s a good game, keep it simple maybe a little harder to play and all will be good, I personally don’t feel like you need to specify bots simply because you don’t specify it’s actual real people either.",6.0

Bumper.io,Really short sighted idiotic ad placement,1.2.0,1.0,I don’t normally write reviews but this game has such a terrible flaw in it I feel I have no choice and hope the idiots that did this read it and fix it. Placing ads at the bottom of the screen for a touch screen based game that results in your finger going all over the screen is stupid because it will interrupt game play and kill you in the middle of a game when the ad pops up. It’s sooooooo stupid. The game itself is fun. But this ad is a serious flaw. And the game runs ads every round which is excessive. So much so I think they did it on purpose to make ppl pay for ad free version. In my case i absolutely won’t because I’m not going to reward that kind of intentional design.,0.0

Just a suggestion I thought would be fun, overall good game tho; the adds are a bit of a drainer but the game makes up for it",0.0
Bumper.io,Awesome game but...,1.2.0,4.0,"This is the best concept for a game I have seen. I have been waiting for a game like this for a while and to see it blow up like this is amazing! To further populate this game and help it grow it would benefit to create more features for the game. For example; customisation for your cart, a leaderboard feature to compete with your friends, an online feature to compete with your friends and to teams game mode where you can play with your friends or with online players. Also reducing the ads will greatly benefit the game’s rating as a lot of people do not like to have to view an ad at the end of every game, maybe reducing it to every 2 or 3 games would be a great start to see how people react. One major negative is that the game lags a lot on my phone, I have an iPhone 5s and have had it for 5 years, it is my first phone, even though my phone is old, other games that required more power from the phone don’t seem to lag, I started investigating and I think it may be because of the ads that appear on the screen during a game.

Ultra Sharp,WAAAAYYYYY too many adds,1.3,3.0,Cool game but the adds are it downfall. I know they are trying to push the pay for no adds thing but it’s just ridiculous.

Ultra Sharp,Imprecise and overpriced,1.3,2.0,"The accuracy needed to do precision cuts is lacking. Overall, a fun game but the number and frequency of ads increase to the point you either have them removed or delete the game. If enjoying a game I’m prone to pay to have the ads removed though that still leaves you at the publishers mercy as to how many  “game ads” they roll into the developers portfolio as these are not considered ads. The logic of this escapes me which leaves only greed as the motivation. Therein lies the problem with the price being set at $4.99.  Since the shift from purchase to “free” games, the cost for entertainment has skyrocketed but $4.99 just to remove ads is high in comparison to other games offering the same.  I’ll delete this game as it is neither unique nor enjoyable enough to justify the price. Also, since I’m already paying with the more expensive commodity of time spent viewing ads (money you can make. Time not so available.) to play I’m disgusted being forced to pay an addition monetary amount that is overly inflated. We consumers are be herded into acceptance. This trend needs to be stopped at some point. This is game and price is my limit.",0.0

Even if the game is set to silent, the ads blast you at full volume. I have to put my entire phone in “do not disturb” mode to stop the ad sounds. I would pay to remove ads, but the game isn’t worth $5 to me. The obnoxious ads ruin an otherwise decent game. Dropped another star for the way this app responds when I turned of the data sharing. It puts a reminder at the top of the screen stating how awful I am for wanting privacy. I ignored it, but the app opens the privacy options every few min asking me to please reconsider sharing my data! I also noticed that when I close out of the app, the settings are reverted to sharing data when I log back in. You win game... it’s time for deletion.",0.0

I checked my phone to see if it had some sort of bug and then I realized that my WiFi and cellular services were both turned off.

Ultra Sharp,Very fun,1.3,4.0,Very fun game with increasingly harder level which I love my only complaint would be there should be a coin system and hint instead of just having to watch a video to skip you should get coins from each level that allows you to spend them for hints to help you through the level instead of just skipping it and not finishing it knowing how to finish it,0.0

Ultra Sharp,A ok game,1.3,3.0,"This is a good game especially when you are bored. I like the way it is so simplistic but it makes you think. The downside to this is that there aren’t too many of these but there are a bit of advertisements. Whenever I want to get a hint advertisements, after a few levels advertisements.Also the prices are not great for the amount you get £0.99 for 15 hints no thank you it is a bit of a waste for something not even physical. On my last sentence you probably thought it is only £0.99 it is not expensive, your right but it encourages kids to spend more money on other games and can waste money. To stop this problem the developers can make a in game currency you earn from every level then you can spend them on hints, backgrounds, cutting lines etc. But other than the things I have mentioned I think it is a ok game.",0.0

Ultra Sharp,Ultra Sharp review,1.3,5.0,"I thought it was a lot of fun playing as simple as it was, hands down most enjoyable mobile game for me at least I just wish you could create your own custom levels and upload them so other people can play them as well as you. There's also another thing I'd like to point out, I really really really wish that there were a lot more levels like I finished the game in 3 minutes (literally) because when I finished I saw the end screen and I thought to myself: really? That's it? Shame, I had so much fun playing that! Anyways that all from me I really enjoyed the game so thank you for making it, and If the two things I ask of you are possible make either if not both, happen, please? With sugar on top? Anyways thanks lion studios, This is NergySlasher56 Signing out",0.0

I’m not sure yet if you can earn hints but right know I have used one but had to watch a video. Ads do pop up but not all the time I’d say 2times/3 there is a short ad about another game but apart from that it’s fantastic. One hack to how to delete the ads is to play on aeroplane mode if you have an iPhone and with androids turn of WiFi and mobile data. -1 star for the hints and ads but apart from that YAY!,0.0

Ultra Sharp,Good Game!,1.3,4.0,"Ultra Sharp is a great game to play to pass the time. The quality is excellent. It’s annoying that there are lots of advertisements and it would have been good if you got 10 or 20 free skips at the start instead of buying ten skips for £0.99 or getting one skip by watching a video. I would recommend downloading this app but it can be annoying at times when you have no skips, need to skip a level and you can’t be bothered to watch ANOTHER video. If these minor improvements were made I would easily give this game 5 stars, even more if I could.",1.0

It says “GET 3 STARS NOW!” And when I tap on it, I’m always brought to an ad. This is a bad game business wise. Other than that, it’s kinda fun.

The guy in the ads only shows up once in a while, and all you have to do is make the ball touch him and you win the level. No catapult like the ads stated.

Hello Stars,Dude seriously?,1.8.6,1.0,So when I saw the add I did had the same level exactly like this other game called “ love balls” and when I was listening to the ad music it was as the legend of Zelda music so basically this game took music and a level from about another game... dude seriously?! 🤨,0.0
Hello Stars,Mr. Sleepy might have a reason to stay awake if this game wasn’t so boring..,1.8.6,1.0,"After every “level” there are new ads. At first it’s difficult to navigate whether or not you’re denying the ad or accepting your “prize”.. or if you have to accept the ad to obtain the prize.. It wouldn’t be so bad if the levels didn’t take literally two seconds to complete. Which brings me to my next point.. there is minimal game progression. The same unoriginal level layouts are repeated I assume so that the app can appear to contain more content than it does. The ads will provide small rewards for limited amounts of time, so unless you’d like to pay for extra content (different balls, etc) you don’t have many other options. Overall this game looks and plays like a flash game from 2003. Mr. Sleepy might have a reason to stay awake if this game wasn’t so boring.",0.0

Hello Stars,Worst Game Ever,1.8.6,1.0,It’s not even entertaining at all! I downloaded this game when I saw it as a Instagram app and it’s literally pointless. When they show it on the app you would feel as if it’s all about getting the stick man to behave at work or wherever he is but in reality your getting a ball to touch the star. You only get to see the man ever other 5th level and when you do it’s not even challenging. This game is pointless and boring it needs to be more engaging! After 3 minuets of playing since I downloaded I’m at level 34. Will be deleting this game after leaving this review. Thanks for the waste of time👍🏾,0.0

Hello Stars,Fun game but very misleading,1.8.6,3.0,Although the game is fun to play I find the advertisements I saw for this app misleading because it makes it look like every level is you targeting mr s but mr s only shows up once every 10 to 12 levels and hasn’t been seen since level 101 and the game is at 221 levels at the moment with more levels about to be released some time soon. I hope they release more levels with mr s.,0.0

Hello Stars,Horrible game,1.8.6,1.0,I saw an add for this on YouTube and thought you have you use a water balloon and wake the guy up but it turns out you just get the ball to a star. The game is addicting and I made it to level 32 in 2 mins. But all the levels are basically the same and don’t get any harder. I wouldn’t recommend this game unless you are trying to keep a kid busy. I also hated the fact that the guy keeps saying “ I’ll see you at level 40” and all of that dumb stuff. There are also illegal adds. I definitely wouldn’t recommend. Very disappointed 😡🤬😤,0.0

In this game, a perfect round earns 3 stars. But, this scheming game freaking SUBTRACTS a star if you skip the ad? I am amazed that people tolerate this nonsense?!
The simplicity of this game makes hints seem completely unnecessary. Therefore, I did NOT agree to watch ads to earn hints.",0.0
Hello Stars,Please read,1.8.6,4.0,So the reason I gave this app 4 stars and not 5 is because this is game is really fun but there are some issues first on is that the advertisement for this is trying to hit someone with a ball to wake them up or get them off of something and stuff like that but actually most of the game is trying to get starts by hitting the ball and getting the star I mean you still get to hit the people with a ball to wake them up and stuff but that’s just some of the game and not as much as I expected but I still love the game I’m not complaining and I also think you should download it because it’s really really fun!,6.0

Hello Stars,I’ll probably delete it in a few days,1.8.6,2.0,"So I saw the ad for this game on Snapchat and it was waking up the guy and I thought “oh cool so I guess the game is waking up the guy and it gets harder every round, that’s seems fun” I downloaded the app and the first level saw exactly how I expected, u wake up the guy with the ball, but then the next level was just getting the ball to a star... so basically the whole game is making the ball get the star and the guy only shows up every once in a while. So I thought “ok this is basically every other app game...great. But I keep playing just to see how it is and the levels don’t get much harder, they all seem the same... I’m on level 31 and I just got this game like actually 2 mins ago, so that’s my other problem, I’m getting bored cause all the levels r kinda the same with the exception on the guy who only shows up once in a while and those levels r super easy. So I think this game would be better if the guy was in every level and not just whenever and also make the rounds more challenging every round. I’m gunna keep playing but if I get to level 50 In 2 more mins I’m gunna delete it.",56.0

Hello Stars,Eh,1.8.6,2.0,Could be fun. Sometimes won’t give you all the stars unless you watch a video of some sort. Also consistently harasses you with ads (either watch a video for coins or get all stars if you watch a video or other game ad) and then directly after ad asks for money to get rid of ads.

There are 3 different ways you can play this game. 1:making a line  to get the ball to wake up the person. 2:trying to hit the star by drawing a line, or 3: the challenge mode to try to hit as many people on the head as you can.

Hello Stars,Very good!,1.8.3,5.0,I have been looking for a fun game that you can play offline and I think I found it! This is a awesome puzzle game!,0.0
Hello Stars,Too many ads on free version,1.8.3,1.0,Why have so many ads?,0.0
Hello Stars,Chock-full of illegal scam ads. And I mean FULL,1.8.3,1.0,"Not just ads... feature length films. Some of the “challenge” levels are tricky, and after every fail you get “renew?” Then a feature-film length ad. Then you have two seconds to get it juuuust right (many levels require absolutely perfect timing) then another ad. I’m deleting this game and checking to make sure I don’t have any more games by the same developer as I will delete those, too. Some degrees of avarice are so profound they should never be rewarded. Besides, after a few attempts all I feel is rage against the developers, the ad generator company, and every product advertised. No leisure time activity should generate this much rage.

IMPORTANT NOTE AND WARNING:

By the way, several of the ads included are well-known hoaxes and scams, like the Cicret smart bracelet and that diet pill that lies about having been on Shark Tank (the shark tank episode shown was for a nootropic shot geared at college kids). The fact that this developer associates with illegal scam advertising tells you everything you need to know about them. The game is specifically designed to put you at financial risk as often as possible.

It’s a shame because it’s a clever game. Too bad the developers have made such unfortunate business choices. If they switch to an ethical advertising structure and have a more reasonable number of ads, I might re-install. I’ll watch this space for their announcement of change.",34.0

Hello Stars,Copyright?,1.8.3,1.0,"Listen, I don’t know a whole lot, and I know that this game uses the idea of a similar puzzle game and not the actual game, but I think that stealing and using music that you didn’t develop is copyright infringement. In one of the ads that was played on YouTube, music from The Legend of Zelda was played, with no credit given. I looked it up, and musical works and songs are covered by copyright law, which makes using this law downright stealing. Plus, they portray the game in a way so that it looks fun, but when you load up the game, it just looks and feels bad.

The game itself is pretty bad too. Every puzzle ends up being recycled, which wouldn’t be too bad if they weren’t the easiest things to solve.

Also annoying is trying to go back over games in order to pick up additional stars in order to progress to the next chapter- and even completing a chosen game first time, no additional stars are given, and you are then forced onto completing the sequence of games again until you once again hit the ""not enough stars to progress to the next chapter"" message.

 Still asking this after several years.... add an “user option setting” ( yes that means an option / setting one can toggle on and off as an end user lemmings ) to route so that one arrives to said address on that side of street of that address routed to.

2.  Routing has become more and more unreliable and very foolish over that last 2 years... especially the last 3-4 months.  Less route options given,  and routing itself now all to often routes one in “ grandpa’s detour” to say it nicely. 

3. Crashes and construction detours are usually marked on map,  but oddly still seems to route that way and says it will be less travel time... but it never is.

In fact Justin detail found maggots only after days of the spill underneath the carpet and foam. I soaked the truck with baking soda and distilled vinegar trying to remove the smell. No way that worked. I googled retailers near me and found high ratings for a business named Justin detail in Newport News va. Summary after Justin his wife Carmen and staff spent 4 long days of relentless work and smell tests I picked up my truck today and the smell was gone. This is the first review I have ever written and probably ever will. This family proved trust integrity hard work determination and proof to successfully rid the overwhelming stinch of throw up in my truck. By the way the detail of the truck inside and out was showroom quality. I was only charged $250 only because I was a first time customer.

Google Maps - Transit & Food,Never again,4.56,1.0,"Will never use for directions again. Moved to a new state, built a house with a lake behind it. Since maps had given me wrong or too late for city lane changes for exits, etc that since we were in a new city I turned on GPS with Google maps to see if it would take me to the house. When it said u have arrived I was on other side of lake looking at the back of our house and it pinned our location right in the middle of lake. One late night before we moved google directed me to an exit that, I swear was an interstate to no where! I exited as instructed it was lower than interstate I was exiting from. As soon as I was down the ramp I thought I was in a Hitchcock movie, I could see the start and end of this interstate only by turning my car around so lights would shine on each end. Of course middle of night, by myself and a woman! But the grass was so high in the MEDIUM of this interstate to nowhere, that I couldn’t see the exit to get back up to the interstate I had exited from. I literally moved my car 360 to see anything. The darkest night I’ve ever seen but has anyone been on an interstate that’s not light up, even on to nowhere.. I knew the second i was down the exit enough to see where Google directed me to, which I blindly followed Google maps instructions like it was God,  obviously, I was scared to death. When I finally got out of there I took the first exit just to pull in somewhere to calm down, what the heck was a four lane interstate a mile long and had been there a long time since weeds were as high as my car but most importantly how and why did Google even pick this exit anyway? It can’t find a legitimate new address per Google, couldn’t because it’s new but can locate to an old dead interstate with no address on it or exit number. From then on I never used it to drive to new places, I couldn’t trust it. I toyed with it locally due to being able to hopefully find my way back if google got lost. To the previous comment that hadn’t used iPhone maps in a long time, it’s now awesome. The only drawback it doesn’t show gas station, places to eat, etc that you’ll be driving close to me. For me I do like that feature since driving alone can’t expand or contract screen and LOOK at what’s ahead, I’m driving and that’s what maps should easily show or speak when asked but not important enough to use google maps on long drives that I’ve never been to. I’ll take the risk that the sign that shows gas at next exit isn’t a place straight out of the movie Deliverance. Sorry so long but had some extreme issues with Google maps and with Apple maps I trust I’ll get to my destination without trips through the looking glass. Hope my true review made u chuckle at least and if u haven’t tried Apple maps in a long time, try it again, Waze is getting better every day it has gave an accurate cops ahead alert several times.",0.0

My biggest complaint of all about the app is the messed up street view. The street view with the blue lines is seriously broken. It’s almost unusable at this point. Some intersections have 6 blue lines running in all different directions. The intersection looks like a maze including ones the run up into the sky!

Google Maps - Transit & Food,More Google Imaging,4.53,5.0,"Good evening, currently the company I work for at are doing full 360 tours within one of Britain’s largest retailers. I was emailing to enquire whether we could set up a meeting to discuss how our systems could work together I.e links on your maps so the public can look around the stores, properties to buy, land for sale and for other engineering aspects I.e it would help with various permits for access to roofs etc and so people can see various bits they can see clearly which are currently on google maps. 
We are also currently in the process of creating tours at various universities and schools which our clients are really keen to do for new pupils so they know what to expect and have a quick look around the campus so it won’t be so daunting on the first day which could also I think be linked to your system.
If you would like to meet and discuss just so you can see what we currently do and maybe discuss what we could do to help you, with that would be great.

Google Maps - Transit & Food,Weird stuff creeping in,4.53,3.0,"I used to rely 100% on Google Maps but recently it seems to have become far less reliable. I’ve just been on a journey where I selected the optional route and pressed start and ended up on the default route anyway. Last week, the app took me off the motorway (leave at exit xyz) routed me next to the motorway (that was flowing freely) for 3 or 4 miles then put me back on. It then only flagged my junction when I was level with it so I missed it, then the alternative route that it said had a 4 minute delay, added 30 minutes to my journey despite me only being 3 minutes from the hold-up. My kids have started to make the same comments. Has something changed? Or has Apple done something now that they are finally trying to develop a decent map? I might be trying other apps anywayz",2.0

Google Maps - Transit & Food,Good but some major flaws,4.53,3.0,"Generally a good navigation app and I’ve used it consistently over the last four years. 

However three major areas which I’ve noted as room for improvement. 

FASTER / ALTERNATIVE ROUTE- the app does not take into consideration additional distance when formulating an alternative route. For instance, the App recently tried to divert me to save 8minutes on my journey time but added an additional 35 MILES. This is not acceptable or fuel efficient. The App should make any additional distance clear when offering the alternative route. 

COMPLICATED/ DELAYED INSTRUCTIONS - the app sometimes can give a series of instructions in a very short space of time and sometimes these are inaccurate. The App often corrects these mistakes quickly but I believe this to be dangerous as can panic a driver. 

INDEPENDENT VOLUME CONTROLS. I listen to my music moderately loudly on road trips however when the voice instructions come in over the music, it can be deafening.",0.0

Google Maps - GPS Navigation,Forcing toll roads,4.47,5.0,"I’ve loved google maps and been a heavy user until the latest upgrade. Living in an area with an expensive toll road, I always had the “avoid toll roads” option off by default. The new update doesn’t save the setting and I have to “avoid toll roads “ every time I put in directions. This normally wouldn’t have been an issue if google maps didn’t keep trying to shove the toll road route down my throat. In an hour + commute after selecting the “avoid tolls” option google maps will still suggest it as a “faster alternative” to save 2-3 minutes and switch to it automatically if you don’t manually dismiss the suggestion (hard to do and not safe to while driving). Moreover I have also noticed that it will sometimes suggest the toll road option even if it’s actually a few minutes slower. Seems like a very cheap and annoying way to make money with whatever partnership google has with the toll road company. In any case, if this isn’t fixed I would be switching to Waze or Apple maps.

Google Maps - Transit & Food,"Version 4.54: terrific app - please fix ""OK Maps"" option",4.56,5.0,"PROS: 1-Incredibly useful - you won’t need a Refidex ever again.

2-Update makes it easy to compare the time it takes to get to your destination using different modes of transport (though only after you pick a mode of transport).

3-Saves your search history, so it predicts what you’re searching for as you’re typing in a previously-searched destination. It also allows you to save a destination to make it easier to search for.

4-Tells you how much it would cost to get there by Uber if you’re a user.

5-I like the thumbnail preview and reviews that show up on some places.

6-An update has added white dots on the public transport routes to indicate bus stops.

7-You can save places to make them easier to search for.

HOW TO MAKE IT BETTER: 1-When you put in a destination, show all the different travel-times for the modes of transport straight away, instead of showing just one travel-time.

2-If you type in “OK maps” you can save a map to your device to save on data - but you have to manually zoom in and out to find out how much you can save. It would be better if there was a rectangle that you could move around to choose what to save.

Google Maps - Transit & Food,"Mediocre Performance, Very Poor UI",4.53,2.0,"I used to like Google Maps, and always used it over other navigation software. However, recently I have tried out numerous other systems and I believe that although the actual performance is, for the most part, satisfactory, the UI is very underdeveloped compared to some other maps. Below are some features I would like to see remedied/implemented.

The compass is very inaccurate and slow to respond in comparison to other maps on the same device (which is less than half an year old). The light blue semitransparent circle around the location indicator is also annoying, and, as far as I can tell, pointless in terms of actual functionality (correct me if I’m wrong).

The map itself does not contain information about where the safety cameras are. Future implementation would be helpful, including voice and visual warnings about camera location and type.

Voice and visual guides as to which lanes to be on at all rather complicated junctions would be good, as well as getting ready for upcoming turns. This is already partly implemented but not very detailed. If possible, take advantage of Google Street View and indicate which lanes to be on using images from that. I found that, when I went to the complex roadways of China, Baidu Maps (which had this function) helped me more than Google Maps even though I couldn’t understand the audio.

Voice and visual indications on upcoming moderate and heavy traffic including distance of effect and estimated time to pass. Also slightly increase the predicted time of passing, as it currently underestimates a little.

Take into account how you normally can’t drive up to the speed limit as well as adding in estimated delays for red lights. On Gasman OS, it does this and, in my experience, ends up predicting the trip time accurate to two minutes on almost every occasion.

There are also some other little things that Baidu, Apple and other maps have that would be easy to implement and yet greatly improve customer experience - just take a look for yourself. Needless to say, Google Maps is still very good to use in certain scenarios, but for now, I’ve stopped using Google Maps but I hope to come back to it in the future in light of new updates.",0.0

Google Maps - Transit & Food,After using everyday for a month...,4.50,3.0,"There are a few things that drive us crazy. 

1. When carefully using your fingers to look around it will just scoot 100km in one direction, forcing you to centre view and start again. 

2. You can’t EASILY change from maps to satellite WHEN in a navigation. The layers option disappears behind a more complex settings menu. Using satellite maps as a co-driver can be important in foreign countries to determine wether it’s a bridge or a ferry. Or generally provide more useful data when exploring foreign/remote areas. 

3. Road closed. We navigated 5 hours south in Norway, to find a road closed sign and have to drive 3 hours north to begin the detour. Had we used Waze/Apple maps, we would have known in advance. (Had been closed for 5 months...) 

4. When you manually start manipulating the map to look around, you click on put north up, you will find yourself fighting the auto rotate or zoom. Arghh.

Changes to the app that weren’t required and are now annoying: 
- instead of showing my home and work addresses on the home screen, it now lists restaurants etc that I don’t care about. I use it to check traffic for my commute not go out, I now have added steps every time I use the app
- no longer shows other routes, just tollways. I live 60-90 mins from work. I want to know the quickest way not the most expensive. 
- the arrow no longer knows which way is up and the blue dot is broken/missing. It used to take a minute to orientate itself but now I work it quicker than my phone. 
- Also annoying is the now convoluted start sequence. You’ve made it more complex than it was. Not useful when driving, more of a distraction. 
- AND why so slow all of a sudden? I had started to use the audio instructions when driving late at night and they have become delayed making me miss turns etc.

Google Maps - Transit & Food,Good work!! 🙂,4.48,3.0,"I’ve always been a great user of Google Maps, on my Apple iPhone 4, Sony Experia Z2 and now iPhone X. 

Well just have to say, when I used on iPhone 4 was the best because, I used to use the map on a lock screen, and the maps would show/ view automatically every time I had a turn even its on lock screen, which was so convenient when you drive alone, so I don’t have to touch my phone. (I keep the screen locked, otherwise it just drains the battery life, no matter what phone) 
But this feature didn’t work on Experia Z2. And the only good thing useful was that when I use google maps, I keep in lock screen, and as it doesn’t show automatically in a turn like in iPhone 4, but still I can continue viewing maps, when I press power button (so I don’t have to unlock phone and press the ongoing maps app). 
But now the worse experience is on iPhone X, since none of the features work on a lock screen. It doesn’t show automatically, in a turn on lock screen. Also on iPhone X even though the maps app is prioritised, when I lock my phone, the maps will not show when I just press power button (just like when you simply want to check time, you just press power button, or actually advance phones just need a glimpse, no need to unlock phone) I have to unlock my phone to view maps. The only option is keep phone unlocked, which drains my battery. 

Please change this, like it used to be on iPhone 4, where when the phone is on lock screen, Google Maps would automatically illuminate the screen for turns on ongoing maps, so we don’t have to touch the phone at all when we drive. 

Also please try to include speed limits, just like usual old GPS systems.

Google Maps - Transit & Food,What’s happened?,4.44,2.0,"I loved the app until this year. 
My app has been all over the place recently and with the new update is even worse when I hoped it would get better. 
While trying to use the map it has been: *mirror imaged - telling me to turn left when I’m reality the street was on the right. 
*The arrow doesn’t face the correct way. 
*Takes forever to reroute, especially when the arrow is confused and doesn’t know which way you’re going. 
*Doesn’t seem to know where anything is anymore - directing you the opposite way then rerouting the correct way and  changing it’s mind telling you to go back again.

Instructions for changing the language of the app say I must do it in the web version. So I logon there and change (after a lot of mucking around, since it keeps referring me back to this app Without asking me!) my language to French, which is a bit inconvenient since I don’t want  searchResults in French, but it’s worth a try.

I hate using Apple Maps because it terribly inaccurate compared to Google Maps and often takes me the wrong way but I have now switched over full time and use it daily because at least Apple has an ‘avoid tolls’ option.

Google Maps - Transit & Food,Directional arrow,4.41,1.0,"What happened to the arrow on the blue dot that showed the direction you’re facing? Now, instead of an arrow, there’s a faint blue gradient attempting to show field of view, which gets lost on green/park/water areas, is difficult to see when the screen is on low brightness, or for those without good vision, and isn’t obviously/easily discernible from a quick glance (eg, when riding a bike). Now I have to bring the phone up to my face to try and figure out which direction I’m walking, or stop the bike to look at the map properly. 

Nothing is more usable, obvious, or intuitive than an arrow pointing in the direction you’re facing. Nothing. When Apple Maps was originally released, it didn’t have the arrow, and after years of complaints they eventually caved in and added it. I think that says something about how important it is.

Currently I don’t have any massive idea that could be used in Google Maps. However considering it is Maps. Why not integrate Google Flights into it, with Destination A to Destination B and it can calculate the cost of flight and travel time.

The place itself is romantic and away from the sound of hectic chaos, the silence at Fethard-on-Sea, Wexford would keep you awake at night, you can hear the wheat in the field beside you swaying and the birds gossiping.  Stayed in a local B&B Sanibels 5* great value, close to the course.  Beautiful sites to see in the evening ie. Hook lighthouse.

The Bevel woodwork course is professionally run by Tommy Kelly he is passionate about his woodwork.  From 9am to 5pm the time didn't wait for anyone, totally engrossed in assembling my chair each day and Tommy always at hand to help and guide you with the carpentry tools.  This course is one for a ""bucket list"" because you leave with such positive energy and a sense of great satisfaction.  I still can't believe I made a chair that doesn't collapse underneath me!  We even had a few high fives 👋🏻 from sheer delight or shock! that we completed a functioning chair.  I will treasure my chair in the garden forever more and so thankful Tommy Kelly shared his skills, knowledge through this ""Outrageously fantastic"" woodwork course available to us and a wide choice to select from.  I will be back with my two daughters guaranteed.   Thanking you Kindly Tommy Kelly for creating a wonderful work space and sharing all your talents with us.  Kind regards Aileen Moran",0.0

No we don't want to use navigation because it drains battery like crazy. Why do developers always update things to make it worse?? Try searching for route to another city and have the map zoom out to unrecognisable path and having to zoom back in every 5 minutes. Very close to ditching this and go to apple maps.,0.0

Gone too is the ability to tap a blank space to make the map full screen when in route mode. I will be using City Mapper for biking from now on.,0.0

Google maps got us most of the way there before sending us on a crazy route. We were in the middle of a country road with NOTHING anywhere when we got the message ""You have reached your destination""! We had a booking for the kids to meet Santa at 1:30pm we would have been just on time if not for the absolutely absurd directions. We end up being 25 minutes late. Now I understand that Google maps directions are not always perfect but this was absolutely ridiculous!!! I learnt a valuable lesson tho --- DONT COUNT ON GOOGLE MAPS TO GET YOU WHERE YOU NEED TO GO.  Check the route with at least one other maps app (or better yet a real map) before heading on your journey.

Messenger,Facebook messenger need to pickup the pace,179.0,3.0,"Facebook messenger is seriously lacking behind with simple and small functions that can make it great. 
Facebook has friends that we do not want to share our phone numbers with to be able to communicate on other great and easy to converse instant messaging apps. 
One of those function is to be able to reply directly to a particular message. 
So difficult to handle conversation on Facebook as it doesn’t allow for different topics to be discussed concurrently just with a reply functionality. 
Most times when you go back to an old discussion during a new one the whole thing becomes confusing and then takes longer to type and clarify things with who you are chatting with. 
I can have a discussion in 3 mins on other apps and that same conversation would take me 10 mins on Facebook messenger. 
This is because you talk about one topic finish it up properly and start the next one again.
When you can talk about both same time just directly replying to the exact thing you getting back at.

Messenger,Vette Culture,179.0,1.0,"Purchased a 2001 Prowler from Gino & Eren at  Vette Culture. I was told the vehicle was in perfect condition / like new. 
I paid by wire transfer. Once the car was shipped and delivered the problems started.

 I called Gino numerous times but kept getting Eren who directed back me to the shipper (who they hired by the way). Now being caught in the middle of the dealer and the shipping company (Vette Culture hired to move the vehicle). Neither company would take responsibility for the torn soft top. I had to call the state police because the truck driver proceeded to take the keys and climb back in his truck “car carrier” and attempted to leave with the keys. I called Gino (got Eren again) after an inexcess of Two hrs. trying to get a resolution. I was told by Eren of Vette Culture they wouldn’t take the the vehicle back. I had to sign the delivery paper work as damaged and Vette Culture would take care of getting the damaged taken care of.

Messenger,Ok,179.0,3.0,The app itself is alright but I find it ridiculous that you get notifications to turn on notifications. I don’t care about Facebook enough to get notified that I have a Facebook message. You shouldn’t be required to turn on notifications.

Here are the two things I hate:

1) if I am using my iPhone and I get a message and open it directly as the banner notification pops up, it will not mark it as read unless I exit the chat and enter it again (I’m one of those people that are anal about getting rid of notification bubbles xD ).

Messenger,Get rid of requiring notifications to be turned on,178.0,1.0,Seriously get rid of the stupid requirement to need notifications on.

I can see who’s up and not bother anyone. back in the old days (I know, I’m old) they would ring at our house if we were eating dinner, my daddy said you don’t answer the phone call them back. You don’t have to answer the call! Just like when you go on messenger you see other people on line, YOU DONT HAVE TO TALK TO THEM ALL! They don’t want to have to talk to you either they’re on there just talking to the people they want,  just like yourself. It’s great to see who’s up late at night when I can’t sleep. You don’t have to talk to people just because they’re online you can see them, and that is a convenience that doesn’t mean you have to talk to them all. that’s your own problem if you think you do.I love messenger it’s great!

Someone needs to look at this and fix this issue- I realize I’m only one person and even if I stop using your messaging platform and start using my actual phone to make phone calls and to video chat instead probably won’t matter very much at all to you, but as one of your consumers, my sense of security and expectation of privacy while using your platform should matter a heck of a lot.",0.0

From what I can see, it doesn’t even take your active status just from the app itself. It takes the active stamp from basically whenever your phone is doing something. So you get a text, surf the web, phone call, are asleep and get a notification on something else on the phone etc - this app says “ooh they’re using their phone I’ll tell people they’re online”. No. Pack it in and switch it off. This app is telling others someone is active/has been active on the app when they haven’t been and is causing people serious issues. Enough already.",5.0

Since Facebook decided to implement the “M” suggestion function, it is impossible to get rid of it. After some research, I read that this function can’t be turned off. In their help db they show a “M Setting” with the option for the user to turn it off or on (by default it is on). Well, this preference doesn’t exist. This function is an AI module that learn about you and “propose some suggestions” when in conversation, but it looks more like another forced way to collect user data.

Messenger,8h15,171.0,2.0,"Bonjour. 
J’aimerais vous faire part d’un bug des plus graves concernant votre application. Voyez-vous, il m’est impossible de texter ou même d’écrire en lettres « 8h15 » ou « huit heures quinze » sans que mon message ne s’efface immédiatement ce qui est en soi assez déroutant. Il n’y a aucun problème avec aucun autre chiffre écrit ou épelé à part celui-là (j’ai d’ailleurs testé 9h37 et tout était nickel). 

Il m’est très important de pouvoir communiquer 8h15 à ma correspondance. C’est d’une importance capitale.

Along the line since then the app has undergone several 'updates' that were supposed to improve it though I can safely say it has done anything but. It's been devolved so harshly that now it's a regular occurrence to not receive a notification unless you go into the app itself and suddenly it will show you've received a text like an hour ago but you'd never have been told that, everything takes far too long to send, for example I was trying to send a text that was quite urgent otherwise I'd miss my train. It was a two line small text and it's been over an hour since I sent it and it still hasn't reached the person I was texting (evident by the little circle at the bottom still being an outline instead of being coloured in), in fact it still hasn't been sent as of me writing this! And don't get me started on the bloody video chat feature, Skype is a better option by far, here it's not out of the ordinary for the app to crash and freeze, yes freeze, your phone in a black screen forcing you to reboot the whole device.

I'd gladly move to a different app had I not all my friends and other contacts on this app with mountains and mountains of old, sentimental, and important texts from back when the app was far more than passable. Currently this app is fantastically bad and I 100% urge you not to use it lest you end up like me who depends on it as their only means of communication to some people.

Messenger,Why?,147.0,1.0,"Messenger won’t open, it continues to crash. I have absolutely no way of contacting anyone on my facebook privately. I understand facebook is a free service, always trying to provide a quality and safe social networking site, BUT, was it necessary to make it that you cannot message or contact anyone via message WITHOUT having the messenger app installed? I get the point of it, but what happens when messenger crash’s and we cannot access ANY of our messages until the problem somehow fixes itself or until a new messenger update is released? For some people, including myself on occasion, we cant access our messages for 24hours IF NOT a couple of days until the problem is resolved. Thus being a moderate to decent sized issue hence absolutely no access to the messenger app. As i stated earlier, I understand Facebook is a free service, and i do appreciate the quality and design of it. But it has its flaws, 99% being minor. But the issue i just raised, I personally think is a reasonably decent flaw that makes facebook harder to use and less attractive to want to use. At the end of the day, the more people using facebook = more money for facebook right? Maybe consider trying to fix this problem, it would be beneficial for the franchise and for those who have the same issue as myself because i certainly know I’m not the only one. Other than that main issue, i cant really flaw facebook. There’s always something minor but the facebook team always manages to jump on it rather quickly and fix it. Long story short, if you could make the Facebook and the Messenger application to not need each other to access messages and send messages, that would be great. Let people decide if they want to install messenger to use it, not force them to install by not letting them access any of their messages. Cheers",0.0
