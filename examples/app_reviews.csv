Tomb of the Mask,Overall fun game...but,1.6,2.0,"ENOUGH of the ads. I know the creator wants to make a buck, but this is INSANE! You have to watch an ad after Every Single Attempt. And to make matters worse, the ads are ridiculously repetitive. Game play is cool. Neat game.",0.0
Tomb of the Mask,Would be good if not for the ads,1.6,1.0,"Everything you do requires an ad, it‚Äôs really annoying. $8 a week for this game without having to watch ads or use energy? That‚Äôs absurd. I could see buying this game for maybe $3, but paying $8 A WEEK is crazy. This isn‚Äôt Netflix or a gym membership. It‚Äôs a mobile game, get out of here with your subscription model.",0.0
Tomb of the Mask,AMAZING,1.6,5.0,This game is so indicting and I love it,0.0
Tomb of the Mask,So many ads,1.6,4.0,The game itself is really fun but you go through two ads to start and one every single time you pass a level or fail a level. I understand it‚Äôs how they make money and how it keeps the game free. It just gets annoying after a while.,0.0
Tomb of the Mask,Terrible app,1.6,1.0,"This app has a cool game in it. However the app consists of ads every time you pass a level, fail at a level, open the app, and when ever else they want to put an ad in. You play for 15-30 seconds and then watch an ad that‚Äôs just as long. This ruined the game",0.0
Tomb of the Mask,Why so many ads?,1.6,4.0,So I personally think that why is there so many ads? How about every time an add shows up we should get coins or a free spin on the fortune wheel. But besides the ads the app is really great! That‚Äôs the only thing,0.0

Tomb of the Mask,Great gameplay buried under a pile of annoyances,1.6,2.0,"The actual game here is great. It's very satisfying to play, has a fun art style, and contains a fun mix of puzzle game and fast paced arcade game. However trying to play this game is a chore. You only have 5 lives that take a long time to recharge, you have to watch ads to open chests, continue a level if you die, and after every game unless you pay to remove them. But even paying the few bucks to remove ads doesn't remove the ads to open chests or revive in a level. If you want access to all of the masks, unlimited lives, and a few free coins, it's going to cost you $8 a WEEK. That's insane for a mobile game this simple. I wouldn't even pay $8 to own this game once and they are expecting that weekly to make their game fully playable.

Tomb of the Mask,"Great, few concerns",1.6,4.0,"The game is very fun and addictive. At first, it‚Äôs very slow at getting coins other than the wheel you receive for free every few hours. I absolutely love this game, but I have 2 ‚Äúmajor‚Äù concerns:

1) Firstly, upon loading the game, in net with a screen talking about the weekly subscription (Unlimited energy, 400 coins per day, no ads and some masks). Sounds interesting and helpful, right? Well, they give you 3 days for free, but then it‚Äôs $7.99 per WEEK. Personally, I feel that is very expensive for a single week and I may purchase it if it does lower in price.

2) Secondly, I think it was a great option to have a ‚Äúfree‚Äù and ‚Äúpaid‚Äù option to regenerate a second life per level. I tend to go for the free option, only taking about 30 seconds and returning to the level. But, more than half of the time, the ad doesn‚Äôt even work and I‚Äôm forced to close the app, restart the level and wasting an energy.

Tomb of the Mask,Its good... up until a point,1.6,4.0,"Look dont get me wrong this game has me addicted and ive been playing like crazy, but there are some big problems,

‚Ä¢Advertising- Nowadays you cant get a game without those annoying ads, but some games limit their ad use to a minimum, tomb of the mask is not one of those games. Im getting an ad after every attempt of a level no matter if i win or not, which is crazy annoying (especially when its the same ad) I would suggest doing an ad maybe only when you die in the game, or just give an ad for every 3 plays.

‚Ä¢Gameplay- The gameplay is fantastic for tomb of the mask until a certain point, Ive gotten to about level 43 and have been introduced to a new obstacle, an odd Chinese dragon that runs a horizontal line though the track which kills you if you touch it. The problem with this obstacle is you have to be super observant if you actually want to see this coming because the only warning is one block blinking for about 2 seconds. This has killed me so many times just because I didnt see it coming.

‚Ä¢ In-App purchases- Ok wow, Tomb of the Mask went crazy on in app purchases. Do you want no ads? Here pay $1 so you can have your sanity. Do you want actually good upgrades for you character, here pay this subscription for a couple masks, what about the ability to not have to wait 2 and a half hours for you energy to recharge, boom subscribe to our mobile game. The in app purchases make the game so hard so enjoy. The energy system that restricts gameplay is put it for the sole fact of making you want the subscription or wanting to use all your money to refill. All you have to do is just cut the recharge time in half so the subscription still has use but doesn't punish the kids who want to save their allowance.

Tomb of the Mask,"Good game, really enjoyed",1.6,5.0,"This is a really fun game! I enjoyed it a lot. For the most part, the levels are challenging enough and it seems to me that a lot of thought went into making the game. I only have a few things that I think could be better. First, I would love it if the energy had a larger maximum capacity or replenished faster. I would even be satisfied if I could buy upgrades like that with coins. Also, the levels are really fun and interesting, but some of the later ones just seem much shorter and easier than they should be. I just wish they‚Äôd add a little something to the post 100 levels to make them more enjoyable and less of a colorful pixelated scavenger hunt. For example, I loved that little rolling ball that follows you and I would like more of it. It‚Äôs a shame the late levels don‚Äôt have as much effort put into them as late stages in arcade. Also, there are a lot of ads but I just keep airplane mode on and disable my WiFi to get rid of them. Overall great game and I‚Äôm gonna expect a lot from new levels if they add them.",0.0

Tomb of the Mask,Good but...,1.6,4.0,I love this game but whenever people get to the harder levels and start to die more often you get so close to finishing the level but you did you have to watch an ad or 200 coins right. When you finally revive most of the time traps start right up again and you die again and 200 coins is wasted and about 30 seconds of your life is wasted.

Tomb of the Mask,The wait times for this game is garbage,1.6,2.0,"20 minutes for just one energy is garbage. If it was 2 or 5 you could play the game more consistently but if u die 5 times its over, your stuck playing arcade till u ether have 1000 coins wich is ridiculously high compared with the masks or wait 20 long, boring minutes if u have nothing to do. And the ads just add insult to injury. But if your tired of ads or wait times you could buy a premium wich comes with a bunch of pixels shaped into four masks, no ads, and unlimited energy for a high price of 8 dollars a WEEK. Not monthly, WEEKLY. With all the flaws this game has i won't be surprised if the masks disappear once your premium runs out... one things for sure, once they fix all the flaws of this game there will be a even better game with little to no flaws

Tomb of the Mask,"Good game, but...",1.6,4.0,"This is amazingly well thought out game, however the energy system is horrible. I am only on level 9 and am already out of energy. The way energy SHOULD be used is that to use a shield you use energy, not that you use energy when you die, as this limits gameplay.

Second, the controls are too sensitive. I frequently die because my swipe right registered as down for some reason. Especially difficult on parts where you‚Äôre being chased or have to move fast.

Tomb of the Mask,Best mobile game ever,1.5.2,5.0,"Hands down best mobile game I‚Äôve ever played. It strikes the perfect balance between games you can quickly pick up and play and games with some real depth and content. In an era where hyper casual is dominating the market this game offers a breath of fresh air and breaks the mold from other games in the genre. There is some real depth and thought and challenge to this game that is unmatched. I‚Äôm rating the game 5 stars for the amazing and addictive gameplay. Overall the game is not without its flaws like the annoying music and SFx but I just mute the audio. Also, the ads are a nightmare. An ad after everything you see or do. And a subscription model to remove ads? These guys sure know how to make money. If it was any other game I‚Äôd have deleted it by now without a standard option to remove ads for $$0.99 or something, but because the core gameplay is so good I still rate it 5 stars. Don‚Äôt rate a game bad simply cause it has an annoying monetary system. Rate a game for what the game is and if you do that then this deserves 5 stars. Thanks devs for putting in the effort to make something truly great!",0.0
Tomb of the Mask,Potential for greatness,1.5.2,2.0,"This gameplay and level style is really creative and fun to play. However, the experience is RUINED by a cluttered app full of ads. Literally to finish a level you have to watch a video, to move on to the next level you have to watch a video, and you have to see another add if you want to replay a level after dying. On top of that, you have five lives for every few hours, or you can watch a 30 second video for a free revive. So when it comes down to it I‚Äôm spending much more time watching ads than playing the game. Oh, but not to worry. You can play the premium ad free version for $8 a f*****g WEEK! What kind of subscription for a free game is that?! It‚Äôs so sad to see an amazing game destroyed by a stupid cash grab.

Tomb of the Mask,Amazing Concept - Poor Execution,1.5.2,2.0,"First thing: There is a ton of ads and money grabbing shoved down your throat at all points in this game. 

For example, one of the first things you‚Äôll see when you start up the game is a full yellow page advocating you to purchase VIP. For $8.99 a WEEK. Yeah. A week. My Netflix subscription is less money than that. Basically any subscription is less than that. Do NOT buy the VIP upgrade. 

They really have gone too far with the ads and money grabbing. You have the basic stuff like watch an ad for energy, chests, etc... then you have the ads after every level wether you win or lose; you have ads when you click X number of buttons; you have an ad bar at the bottom of the game at all times. It‚Äôs honestly a little game ruining for me. I love the concept of this game so much. I played a demo in another game as an ad and immediately wanted to get the full app. 

The art style is interesting and new for me. This type of game isn‚Äôt something I normally play so it‚Äôs a nice change. I would really love to fully enjoy this game without having to pay $2.99 to remove ads and still have all the other Pay to Win bs. Or pay $8.99 every stinkin week. 

Another complaint I have is the energy. 5 MAX energy.. really? But wait! You can just purchase VIP and get unlimited energy! No thanks.

Tomb of the Mask,"Way, way, WAY too many ads.",1.5.2,3.0,"Don‚Äôt misunderstand me, the game is pretty good, seems polished and it‚Äôs very entertaining.
A few important criticisms:
First, the map looks like a sideways never ending snake, and the game is represented as a tower in the ads and in the start screen, so it would make sense to make it go up, instead of sideways. Also, you should make it look more interesting with dungeons, special levels or something like that. 
Second, the most important part: the are WAY too many ads. One when you finish a map level, one when you finish an arcade level, and when you open the game (two in that case). Also, there‚Äôs a constant banner on the lower side of the screen. 
These guys must be making a lot. I think I‚Äôve seen more than 70 adds from this game, just this day.
Also, the subscription doesn‚Äôt add too much to the gameplay, is constantly shoved to your face, and costs a lot of money.

Tomb of the Mask,"Great game, ruined by a few things.",1.6,4.0,"This game is actually really good. The game has pleasing visuals and the levels are cleverly designed. The amount of work put into this game is reflected by the finished product. However, I will not hesitate to complain. 

Firstly, ads. Yes, it has been mentioned in reviews quite a lot, but the amount of adverts in this game is unreal. Whilst the game is free and ads are expected, ads every time you lose a game is too much. Not only that, but there are also ads at the bottom of the screen whilst you play a level, distracting you from the actual gameplay. Therefore, I was forced to play with Wi-Fi turned off which I hate doing since it‚Äôs cutting off the money supply of the developers. One ad every couple of ended games would be better, but if the developers did what Crossy Road did (where ads are optional and you have to actually press an action to get the ads and a reward) that would be so much better. 

You can remove the ads however through a ¬£2.99 one time payment, but considering that other developers give this option for only ¬£0.99, it seems a bit too much. 

On the other hand, you can choose to get a subscription with multiple rewards that costs ¬£6.99 per week. That is super expensive, amounting to almost ¬£360 per year. Now, these sort of games come and go so I doubt anybody would keep a subscription for that long as they‚Äôd get bored of the game within a month or so (hence the large price of the subscription), therefore I‚Äôd like to be a bit different and give the developers a pass on this one. However, even a slight drop of price on both the subscription and one time payment would be appreciated. 

The game also has energy levels, something I would associate with mediocre games, but with this game, it made sure I didn‚Äôt play too much and hence get bored of the game. But also, they could be used to get you more hooked on the game by playing little by little each day, making this a daily habit (and more likely to pay the membership), but once you pay the subscription to get rid of the energy levels, the developers wouldn‚Äôt really care about that anymore as the whole point of it was to get you to pay up. I wouldn‚Äôt like to be so cynical though. 

On final remarks, I appreciate this game‚Äôs usage of the latest features like the Taptic Engine and optimisation of the iPhone X‚Äôs display. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, this is a really good game and the positives really outweigh the negatives. But please listen to the feedback, Playgendary. That would be much appreciated. Oh and also, the design of this game is absolutely gorgeous. This game‚Äôs designer(s) should get a raise.",0.0

Tomb of the Mask,"What a concept, but no execution",1.4,2.0,"The game stands out immediately as something that is original with a hint of the mobile games that will go down in history as not terrible clones of previous successes hoping to cash in on the victory of other mobile game creators. 

The gameplay in itself is fun, an essence of Pac-Man fills each level as you jump around the tomb based levels, collecting tiny dots and stars to progress to the next level and so on. This in itself is quite a basic concept but as proven by games of the retro genre, it‚Äôs addictive.

However, the levels would be far more brilliant if the controls worked with each swipe. Consistently I have found myself swiping in a particular direction only to be sent flying the complete opposite way, almost as if the slightest nudge in a different direction to my inputted command somehow overrides all previous decisions I‚Äôve ever made. This leads to an immediate death in most circumstances, presenting you with another pay for life screen. 

Amongst this, you will have to pay for energy, watch ads to gain revenue for the game creators and also pay for their premium membership which is advertised to you every 3 nanoseconds, even if you close the advert using the provided cross, there‚Äôs no guarantee that this will indeed close the ad, and you may have to wait for longer until the game creators decide that it‚Äôs time to remove the ad because the constant barraging is not going to make you pay ¬£5 for new masks.

Overall this game had potential to make history on the App Store as one of the few semi-original concepts with perfect execution. However, when the creators spend more time placing focus into how many ads can be shown in a 2 minute window and draining your wallet dry for lives, the core gameplay suffers and it is evident here in waves.",0.0

If you get tired of running out of energy (basically the life system of the game) it offers you ‚Äòdiamond membership‚Äô que flashy lights and confetti. The price for this membership is ¬£6.99. Per. Week. This adds up to around ¬£27 per month, the price of your average second hand triple X title after a few months. The average price of a phone contract or home internet direct debit. For an IPhone app. This to me is the most overpriced thing since the US defence budget. For this sin and this sin alone it receives a measly two stars. To you developers I say shame.

Tomb of the Mask,Used to be addicted to this,1.2.26,3.0,"The gameplay is fluid & well tuned. That ought to be the main thing right? Normally I‚Äôd agree.

I don‚Äôt like the ad system, way too reliant on that now (even though the game wasn‚Äôt always like that).

But the biggest annoyance for me is the stubbornness of the devs to refuse support for iCloud saving. I spent a long time playing this, got all the masks, then bought a new phone. I didn‚Äôt want to reinstall all my apps, but wanted to start a fresh. I‚Äôd asked the devs before if they would be supporting iCloud saves & the answer was basically a no, and we never will.

For a game that takes so much time to progress, this is a big issue for me & essentially stopped me playing. Lost my progress & now I need to endure the new progress format to get to that same place.

Tomb of the Mask,Unbelievable,1.2.26,1.0,How to ruin a fantastic game that was quick to pick up play and put down.

Tomb of the Mask,A little slice of indie gold,1.2.9,5.0,"Never have I become 'addicted' to a mobile game until now. 

I loved the original arcade only version of the app, trying to collect all the masks and power everything to max. I was dubious of the newer level system, but upon completing all 75 levels I have to admit it's simply the best moment-filler. Short, tricky tests for your brain and reflexes which fill just enough time for when you are waiting for that bus or friend who's always late.

The simplicity of the pixel style graphics does not detract from the beauty of the visuals, with the graphics having a definite upgrade when the level system was introduced (kudos to the developer for that).

Any masks you unlocked will also be gone.

Please don't sue me it's just for my uni project. I stopped watching adds since it's only 300 coins for the ad. I used to watch them religiously. I feel like movement mechanics are a wee bit worse, like I accidentally go where I didn't intend to. And last but not least I think this game would be a lot better with some simpler mechanics allowing player to stay longer in a game. Then I would be more willing to pay for an in-app content. And screw it: why not give 5mln coins for ¬£5? It's ¬£5! That's a lot for a app but still you'd get only 30k coins? That doesn't seem fare. But I'm just a student I don't know much about merchandising just yet. All in all the programmers did a great job, graphics is amazing but I'd rather see it going crazier and bolder.

Tomb of the Mask,Great Retro Endless Game,1.0,5.0,"The game incorporates the retro, 8 but style, and the endless genre into one game. The game constantly pushed you forward with the rising screen from the bottom up. If you are not fast enough, it will catch you, causing end game.  There are also obstacles located around labyrinth, which are blue, and must be avoided at all cost. Both of these aspects keep he mind on edge at all times. There is an option to revive for a certain amount of coins (500), or to watch a video. I am not sure if this hanged the further on you get, as I have not progressed too far within the game as of yet. There is a shop feature, which allows you to buy new masks, which is your character, with the coins you collect within game. There is also a prize wheel which is like a lucky dip. You pay 200 coins, and receive on the the prices from the wheel, such as some coins. I would recommend this game to anyone interested in the endless genre, or retro feeling games.

Here‚Äôs why: when you updated the game and added more levels, I have beaten each one of those levels under an hour (literally) and didn‚Äôt really give me the feel of a harder aspect of a higher level. Also could you possibly make the levels increase in difficulty always because when I was beating the final levels I realize that levels 190 - 195 were much easier that levels 185 - 189 which to me doesn‚Äôt make sense, since levels 190 - 195 are higher they should be more difficult than 185 - 289.

Tomb of the Mask,Game doesn't want to be played,1.5.1,3.0,"This game's greatest asset is the gameplay itself. It's straightforward, satisfying, responsive, and visually pleasing with a concrete aesthetic. Unfortunately, it seems to be designed to let you experience the actual gameplay as infrequently as possible.

The first problem is that the game is riddled with ads. They appear constantly, in between what seems like every single menu interaction. But Airplane Mode effectively solves this problem, even if you can't claim the free chests while offline.

Extraneous menu navigation is another problem. If you happen to die in the game, you have to navigate through no less than three menus, sometimes taking upwards of 1 minute because of ads, just to attempt the level again. It's something that severely messes with the normally fast-paced gameplay experience. A quick ‚ÄúRetry‚Äù button on the Revive screen would be extremely beneficial.

The game's final shortcoming is the presence of a seemingly useless ‚ÄúEnergy‚Äù system that limits for how long you can actually play the game. Typically, this mechanic is used in collectible-type games, multiplayer games, or in some other game to discourage significant grinding. It doesn't really belong in this kind of game with many levels and quick gameplay. Obviously, this game implements this in order to push for microtransactions just to be able to play the game for more than a few minutes at a time. It's a disappointment, and I guarantee that nobody would complain if it were removed entirely.

Above all, the gameplay is charming and interesting, but is irredeemably held back by bad UI and predatory money-grubbing practices. It's a shame, because I would easily pay a fair amount up-front for this game without ads or unnecessary limitations.",0.0

Negative!
Every time you finish the mission, you will get ads every time.
The graphics could be better and the loading screens are slow, the game is mostly about ads cause you can get everything with it and they should change it ¬´ to much ads ¬ª.
Its kinda repetitive you do the same thing over and over, of course more stuff appear and it gets harder.

The sounds are interesting, the arcade mode is nearly perfect (nearly), and it‚Äôs got the makings of a great classic for a large fan base.

The bad: First off, this is an extremely buggy game. It‚Äôs highly unresponsive to finger swipes, and when it is responsive, it‚Äôs a step behind. Nearly all of my deaths on stages is caused by my guy going backwards instead of forwards when I clearly swiped forward. From what I‚Äôve gathered, this may be due to a (recent?) update, but this needs to be fixed. Second, the number of ads is absolutely ridiculous. There is absolutely NO reason to require watching an ad after EVERY single stage. I realize that they are your sponsors and they pay you to play these ads, but the more times you play those ads, the more infuriated I get and definitely the LESS inclined I am to support them, or you. Less ads played. Not ‚Äúno ads played,‚Äù but less. Third, the Energy system is also ridiculous. I shouldn‚Äôt have to pay for lives, and certainly not only FIVE at a time. Either the Energy system needs to be abolished altogether (this is what should happen), or increase it and remove the waiting period. I understand watching ads to replenish them, but waiting for them if I don‚Äôt want to watch ads is still ridiculous. I‚Äôm more likely to delete the game in that waiting period then I am to support it. We don‚Äôt mind ads, but we DO mind LOTS of them. Tone it down.

Again, COULD be a great app, and I would consider paying to support it further, but not until it‚Äôs more worthy to do so.",0.0

Tomb of the Mask,"Good - Not Great, But Addicting.",1.2.1,4.0,"Starting with the bad:
Energy/lives should be less of a wait for, especially when the cap is 5 and is such a fast paced level system game. Easy to ""rig""/play your odds in favour of getting coins from the wheel and doubling by ads (ad limit should be put in?) I'm finding myself lost in some levels as its very fast paced but cant really ""see ahead"". Maybe a mini map of sorts would help (obviously not giving away where traps and foes are, but gives the player a rough idea of whats the path is like in the sense of a compass.

Good stuff:
Very fast paced and addicting, I find myself itching to continue to the next level and getting so involved that when I die, I want to throw my brand new phone across the room (in a good way). Like the power ups, but maybe a levelling system for them would be cool rather then a buy and use and re-buy again system.

Don't get me wrong- this is still a great game. It hasn't really gone down in quality. Yet. Every patch strays closer and closer to dangerous ""bad free to play app store game"" territory and I hope that it doesn't continue that way. The most recent update adds a ""story mode"", but this mode has a typical energy live system. You can no longer stack wheel of fortune free spins. The wheel of fortune itself is much worse and there's basically no reason to pay gold to use it now. Ads are starting to be encroached more upon the player- watch an ad to do this. Watch an ad to get this bonus. More and more we're being pushed into this, and I hope it doesn't get to a state of it being an app that I delete off my phone.

I just don't like games with ads... I would prefer to just be required to pay upfront for an ad free experience because when given the choice, I won't put money into a game that I can play for free unless I know I'm going to keep playing it for some time, and ads take a lot away from the enjoyable experience of a game. I think a better method to enhance user experience would be to offer a timed trial of the game for free and then if after that amount of time the user still wants to play the game they must pay for it - so people who like the game will pay for it and be happy; there won't exist any users that like the game and yet are unhappy due to ads. It just takes ads out of the equation.",0.0

Gameplay was fun but the ads were a dealbreaker. 
The devs clearly want to generate a revenue but over saturation of ads means a decent chunk of people will stop playing the game earlier so ultimately you condemn your game.

When you first open the game, every level you complete, little pop-ups at the bottom of the screen 30second ad when you play for complete level 3 which will take you 20seconds.

Tomb of the Mask,Are you for real?,1.4,1.0,This game could be so much fun yet i am slammed with ad‚Äôs everywhere. the game has such simple and good looking graphics but is ruined by ad‚Äôs everywhere not to mention it forcing you to watch ad‚Äôs. This is ridiculous. there should be a $1 feature to remove all ad‚Äôs permanently. not $12 to remove some ad‚Äôs for 1 week. This is disgusting.

Tomb of the Mask,Ripped off,1.3,1.0,"v1.3 is out and not only is the ad disabler iap still non-functional, the game now has a subscription fee (and a new pop-up ad advertising said garbage). The scammers at Happymagenta and Playgendary should be banned from the app store, and every single person they duped into giving them money should be given a refund.

And here‚Äôs my old review of v1.2.27:
This game just updated today. According to the release notes the update contains ‚Äúminor performance and stability improvements‚Äù.
That is a total lie.

What the update actually does is kill the game‚Äôs framerate and add pop-up ads when you start the game and add video ads after every level - even if you‚Äôve paid money to disable them.
That is unacceptable and the people responsible are absolute scum.",0.0

Tomb of the Mask,Too many ads,1.3,1.0,"It is a good game to start with, the only problems are that the controls are terrible, 9/10 lost levels are from it moving the wrong way. Secondly it has way too many ads. After every level/game or every second level/game it plays an add. Seeing as a level is about 1-2 minus, ads are way to often. Could be a great game but developers are too greedy.",0.0

Tomb of the Mask,Intuitive thinking,1.2.23,2.0,"At first glance of this game from commercials on the entire, I generally felt like it looked interesting, something that I had never seen before, yet somehow I could just tell something wasn't right, I downloaded the game anyway.. and to my surprise, the controls were sluggish the graphics were worse than the general ""arcade style"" everyone is used to, and the audio was extremely repetitive, I definently think the creators of this game have what it takes to make an action packed, fun, and entertaining phone game, but this is just not it, go and download geometry dash instead, it has a more challenging level system, and provides more entertainment on the value of sight.",2.0

Tomb of the Mask,Great Game (Suggestion),1.2.5,5.0,"I absolutely love this game, Story mode was a blast and I've spent hours playing Endless.
My feedback would be to have an option to turn off Double Tap for Shields, I play very quickly and have essentially used 30+ shields by accident",0.0
Tomb of the Mask,Fantastic Arcade Game,1.2.1,3.0,"I've loved ToTM since I first installed it. The fast paced, quick movement controls and easy to navigate interface always made it a pleasure to play.

WARNING: If you are installing this game for the first time, the controls were slower than before but still a great arcade game. 

BUT: For experienced players, do NOT install! It will erase your entire progress and the slow control will deploy accidental shields. Slight movements aren't enough to control the character anymore.",0.0
Tomb of the Mask,Change how camera moves back to old version,1.2.1,2.0,The camera feels really weird and slow because of the smoothing you've put on it. It was better before or if you like it at least include an option for both types of cameras. Other than that everything else is pretty good.,0.0

Tomb of the Mask,WARNING DO NOT UPDATE!,1.2.1,1.0,"TOTM is a great game and I have had since release, but since the new update I lost ALL my progress! So if you are new to the game, download it, but if you are an old player DO NOT UPDATE!!!!",1.0
Tomb of the Mask,I Agree with other comment...,1.2.1,4.0,"Tomb of the Mask is one of my favorite endless maze games to break out and play when I am looking for something to do. Everything from the character pixel art to the game audio has been carefully crafted and I am very grateful for the attention to detail they have taken when creating this game!
But... Since this new update with an impressive second option to play, I have noticed the character controls feel kind of 'slow'. Where before I used to make small finger gestures and swipes to move the character strategically around the screen, I must now succumb to slight screen lag, with occasional mis-press triggering an unwanted shield. I hope you are able to fix this compatibility issue, I must assume comes from using an older model iPhone (5c).

Tomb of the Mask,New update,1.2,1.0,"The new update sounds amazing! New levels - just what ToTM fans have been asking for.

I've restarted the app, closed all my open apps, and restarted my phone to no avail.
This is the first big update the game has had and for it to have such a big bug in the system is a massive let down. Please fix this bug.

Sure, you can download their ‚Äúno ads‚Äù by downloading an entirely new app...because that‚Äôs the way it works right? Nah, it doesn‚Äôt, but they make you anyway.

Bumper.io,Fun game,1.2.0,4.0,"I enjoyed this game immensely and I would recommend it (which I have already done) to anyone, with the exception of people who just don‚Äôt like this style of game. I would definitely rate this game five out of five stars if it had these two suggestions added to it. 
     1. Have more tiers that progressively get harder to get to and you need more wins to level up. This would make the game more difficult and fun because after a week of playing this game I reached master 1 and then I just didn‚Äôt have any objective to keep playing for. I considered deleting the app because of the fact that I no longer had a goal or a motivator to play. I just think it would make this game a lot more fun and it would keep players better. 
     2. So anyone who has played the game hole.io probably remembers one of the best features that was a little glitchy but still made the game worth playing. This feature was the ability to play with other devices in your own match so that you could play with your friends. I think that this game should have that feature because it would make it so much more fun and entertaining if this was integrated well (without all of the glitches I experienced in hole.io) into the game. I think this is a great game with a lot of potential for great fun and I think it would be even better with the things I said earlier. Thank you for your time!",0.0

Others such as this one put in way to much adds making it almost impossible to really enjoy the game. after a while you do get used to it, but it still isn‚Äôt fun watching so many adds.

Bumper.io,Awful Game Mechanics,1.2.0,2.0,"The mechanics for this game are both confusing and completely worthless. Since you need to constantly be moving and turning, you‚Äôre constantly charging your rush move.

If the player is hanging off the edge even a little bit, you fall off and can‚Äôt recover. This would be fine if it was the same case for bots, but if you don‚Äôt land a freaking ‚Äúhome run‚Äù hit every single time, the bots just slowly pace themselves back into the arena.

Bumper.io,Multiplayer,1.1.8,3.0,Make this multiplayer like the other iOS. It acts like it is by adding a bunch of lame names for the CPUs such as ‚Äúfurry‚Äù or ‚Äúlambospeed‚Äù. We all know it‚Äôs a fake player when they‚Äôre no memes or slurs as the names of players. I think this game would be a lot more fun if I could play with friends or just actual people.,0.0
Bumper.io,"Good, but also not good",1.1.8,2.0,"The game itself is ok. It‚Äôs fun, but sometimes there r glitches in the ai in their speed and hits also there is too many adds that just straight up ruins the game. But most is ai. It‚Äôs so stupid, because it hits u when it‚Äôs not even by u. So over all is would be a good game. But the ai glitches and adds make is a piece of total crud.

It‚Äôs the choice of generated usernames that I don‚Äôt like. Many of them are EXTREMELY inappropriate, such as the player that beat me in the last game I played dubbed ‚Äúdovakindupenis‚Äù.

First of all they need to fix the rubber banding, once your big, they will come after you and will go for you only.

Next it needs more levels, I know they‚Äôre consistently making more, but they don‚Äôt make many. But great stage designs tho

They also need an online mode, do you know how cool it would be to play against your friends and others around the globe this is something that lets the game down ALOT, playing offline is cool and all, I don‚Äôt use my data when offline, but it‚Äôs just missing something that would make it much better

Some things that I would say would make the game a whole lot better and ensure my 5 star review:

*Give the option to choose whether to play against bots or not, maybe in the form of different game modes like seen in Hole.io.
*Have challenges, which can unlock aesthetics for your character.
*(Following from the last one) Introduce a point system which are collected from completed challenges and used to buy the aesthetics.

I have played and mastered all other IO games, this one however, is the weakest and least engaging in their franchise.  I have deleted the game.",2.0
Bumper.io,Good idea but awful Quality,1.1.4,1.0,This game is an amazing idea and looks nice but is extremely laggy and is not online which most of these games are. Also in this game the offline bots will often team on you and maybe 2-4 ai‚Äôs will push you of the edge. Finally along with the lag this game also has a glitch where you will not be able to move.,0.0
Bumper.io,Things to be improved,1.1.4,4.0,When you get killed or knocked off it says who killed you but that person is always wrong. I also completed the game in like 2 hours and it would be great if you could add more levels after master 1. It would be cool if you could at more accessories to your character like clothes and hats and glasses and stuff like that. But overall it‚Äôs a great game and very addictive.,0.0

It‚Äôs sooooooo stupid. The game itself is fun. But this ad is a serious flaw. And the game runs ads every round which is excessive.

Bumper.io,Awesome game but...,1.2.0,4.0,"This is the best concept for a game I have seen. I have been waiting for a game like this for a while and to see it blow up like this is amazing! To further populate this game and help it grow it would benefit to create more features for the game. For example; customisation for your cart, a leaderboard feature to compete with your friends, an online feature to compete with your friends and to teams game mode where you can play with your friends or with online players. Also reducing the ads will greatly benefit the game‚Äôs rating as a lot of people do not like to have to view an ad at the end of every game, maybe reducing it to every 2 or 3 games would be a great start to see how people react. One major negative is that the game lags a lot on my phone, I have an iPhone 5s and have had it for 5 years, it is my first phone, even though my phone is old, other games that required more power from the phone don‚Äôt seem to lag, I started investigating and I think it may be because of the ads that appear on the screen during a game.

Ultra Sharp,Imprecise and overpriced,1.3,2.0,"The accuracy needed to do precision cuts is lacking. Overall, a fun game but the number and frequency of ads increase to the point you either have them removed or delete the game. If enjoying a game I‚Äôm prone to pay to have the ads removed though that still leaves you at the publishers mercy as to how many  ‚Äúgame ads‚Äù they roll into the developers portfolio as these are not considered ads. The logic of this escapes me which leaves only greed as the motivation. Therein lies the problem with the price being set at $4.99.  Since the shift from purchase to ‚Äúfree‚Äù games, the cost for entertainment has skyrocketed but $4.99 just to remove ads is high in comparison to other games offering the same.  I‚Äôll delete this game as it is neither unique nor enjoyable enough to justify the price. Also, since I‚Äôm already paying with the more expensive commodity of time spent viewing ads (money you can make. Time not so available.) to play I‚Äôm disgusted being forced to pay an addition monetary amount that is overly inflated. We consumers are be herded into acceptance.

Ultra Sharp,Amazing game!,1.3,4.0,I love this game. Although sometimes is can get quite frustrating. The reason I didn‚Äôt rate 5 stars is there are way too many ads. Which makes it hard to play and actually have fun. But here‚Äôs a tip. Turn off your WiFi if you wanna play this game. You can turn it back on when you are done. With no internet there‚Äôs NO ads. It would be a 5  star game if there were less ads. Please fix that it‚Äôs quite annoying.,0.0

Ultra Sharp,A ok game,1.3,3.0,"This is a good game especially when you are bored. I like the way it is so simplistic but it makes you think. The downside to this is that there aren‚Äôt too many of these but there are a bit of advertisements. Whenever I want to get a hint advertisements, after a few levels advertisements.Also the prices are not great for the amount you get ¬£0.99 for 15 hints no thank you it is a bit of a waste for something not even physical. On my last sentence you probably thought it is only ¬£0.99 it is not expensive, your right but it encourages kids to spend more money on other games and can waste money. To stop this problem the developers can make a in game currency you earn from every level then you can spend them on hints, backgrounds, cutting lines etc. But other than the things I have mentioned I think it is a ok game.",0.0

It wouldn‚Äôt be so bad if the levels didn‚Äôt take literally two seconds to complete. Which brings me to my next point.. there is minimal game progression. The same unoriginal level layouts are repeated I assume so that the app can appear to contain more content than it does. The ads will provide small rewards for limited amounts of time, so unless you‚Äôd like to pay for extra content (different balls, etc) you don‚Äôt have many other options.

Hello Stars,Please read,1.8.6,4.0,So the reason I gave this app 4 stars and not 5 is because this is game is really fun but there are some issues first on is that the advertisement for this is trying to hit someone with a ball to wake them up or get them off of something and stuff like that but actually most of the game is trying to get starts by hitting the ball and getting the star I mean you still get to hit the people with a ball to wake them up and stuff but that‚Äôs just some of the game and not as much as I expected but I still love the game I‚Äôm not complaining and I also think you should download it because it‚Äôs really really fun!,6.0

I‚Äôm on level 31 and I just got this game like actually 2 mins ago, so that‚Äôs my other problem, I‚Äôm getting bored cause all the levels r kinda the same with the exception on the guy who only shows up once in a while and those levels r super easy.

Hello Stars,Very good!,1.8.3,5.0,I have been looking for a fun game that you can play offline and I think I found it! This is a awesome puzzle game!,0.0
Hello Stars,Too many ads on free version,1.8.3,1.0,Why have so many ads?,0.0
Hello Stars,Chock-full of illegal scam ads. And I mean FULL,1.8.3,1.0,"Not just ads... feature length films. Some of the ‚Äúchallenge‚Äù levels are tricky, and after every fail you get ‚Äúrenew?‚Äù Then a feature-film length ad. Then you have two seconds to get it juuuust right (many levels require absolutely perfect timing) then another ad. I‚Äôm deleting this game and checking to make sure I don‚Äôt have any more games by the same developer as I will delete those, too. Some degrees of avarice are so profound they should never be rewarded. Besides, after a few attempts all I feel is rage against the developers, the ad generator company, and every product advertised. No leisure time activity should generate this much rage.

IMPORTANT NOTE AND WARNING:

By the way, several of the ads included are well-known hoaxes and scams, like the Cicret smart bracelet and that diet pill that lies about having been on Shark Tank (the shark tank episode shown was for a nootropic shot geared at college kids). The fact that this developer associates with illegal scam advertising tells you everything you need to know about them. The game is specifically designed to put you at financial risk as often as possible.

It‚Äôs a shame because it‚Äôs a clever game. Too bad the developers have made such unfortunate business choices. If they switch to an ethical advertising structure and have a more reasonable number of ads, I might re-install. I‚Äôll watch this space for their announcement of change.",34.0

Hello Stars,Copyright?,1.8.3,1.0,"Listen, I don‚Äôt know a whole lot, and I know that this game uses the idea of a similar puzzle game and not the actual game, but I think that stealing and using music that you didn‚Äôt develop is copyright infringement. In one of the ads that was played on YouTube, music from The Legend of Zelda was played, with no credit given. I looked it up, and musical works and songs are covered by copyright law, which makes using this law downright stealing. Plus, they portray the game in a way so that it looks fun, but when you load up the game, it just looks and feels bad.

The game itself is pretty bad too. Every puzzle ends up being recycled, which wouldn‚Äôt be too bad if they weren‚Äôt the easiest things to solve.

Google Maps - Transit & Food,Justin detail Newport News virgina,4.56,5.0,"one half gallon of good quality chocolate milk spilled all down my seat and drenched the carpet. I had no idea how bad the smell would render rotten throw up. I have a new Ford F-150 lariat. The smell of new car scent was over and now it smelled disgusting. In fact Justin detail found maggots only after days of the spill underneath the carpet and foam. I soaked the truck with baking soda and distilled vinegar trying to remove the smell. No way that worked. I googled retailers near me and found high ratings for a business named Justin detail in Newport News va. Summary after Justin his wife Carmen and staff spent 4 long days of relentless work and smell tests I picked up my truck today and the smell was gone. This is the first review I have ever written and probably ever will. This family proved trust integrity hard work determination and proof to successfully rid the overwhelming stinch of throw up in my truck. By the way the detail of the truck inside and out was showroom quality. I was only charged $250 only because I was a first time customer. I called The Ford dealership in Suffolk Barton ford said $1,400 for new carpet.  Hahha are you kidding. So when I went to tip
Justin extra for all of the extended work he said no we want to make it right it‚Äôs on us. Well i was not going to leave without paying extra because there is no way they made any profit off of this. This family is a gem. If you want excellence for your vehicle and want to earn a friend no where in our area will you find anyone better than carman and Justin no doubt guaranteed!  Do not drink milk in vehicle and always always call this business for the BEST experience. All emotions aside no one can detail a vehicle that good that fast with class anywhere close to us!!!

Google Maps - Transit & Food,Wants to track location ALL the time,4.56,1.0,Why? And I couldn't even turn that off in privacy or the google maps settings.,0.0
Google Maps - Transit & Food,Never again,4.56,1.0,"Will never use for directions again. Moved to a new state, built a house with a lake behind it. Since maps had given me wrong or too late for city lane changes for exits, etc that since we were in a new city I turned on GPS with Google maps to see if it would take me to the house. When it said u have arrived I was on other side of lake looking at the back of our house and it pinned our location right in the middle of lake. One late night before we moved google directed me to an exit that, I swear was an interstate to no where! I exited as instructed it was lower than interstate I was exiting from. As soon as I was down the ramp I thought I was in a Hitchcock movie, I could see the start and end of this interstate only by turning my car around so lights would shine on each end. Of course middle of night, by myself and a woman! But the grass was so high in the MEDIUM of this interstate to nowhere, that I couldn‚Äôt see the exit to get back up to the interstate I had exited from. I literally moved my car 360 to see anything. The darkest night I‚Äôve ever seen but has anyone been on an interstate that‚Äôs not light up, even on to nowhere.. I knew the second i was down the exit enough to see where Google directed me to, which I blindly followed Google maps instructions like it was God,  obviously, I was scared to death. When I finally got out of there I took the first exit just to pull in somewhere to calm down, what the heck was a four lane interstate a mile long and had been there a long time since weeds were as high as my car but most importantly how and why did Google even pick this exit anyway? It can‚Äôt find a legitimate new address per Google, couldn‚Äôt because it‚Äôs new but can locate to an old dead interstate with no address on it or exit number. From then on I never used it to drive to new places, I couldn‚Äôt trust it. I toyed with it locally due to being able to hopefully find my way back if google got lost. To the previous comment that hadn‚Äôt used iPhone maps in a long time, it‚Äôs now awesome. The only drawback it doesn‚Äôt show gas station, places to eat, etc that you‚Äôll be driving close to me. For me I do like that feature since driving alone can‚Äôt expand or contract screen and LOOK at what‚Äôs ahead, I‚Äôm driving and that‚Äôs what maps should easily show or speak when asked but not important enough to use google maps on long drives that I‚Äôve never been to. I‚Äôll take the risk that the sign that shows gas at next exit isn‚Äôt a place straight out of the movie Deliverance. Sorry so long but had some extreme issues with Google maps and with Apple maps I trust I‚Äôll get to my destination without trips through the looking glass. Hope my true review made u chuckle at least and if u haven‚Äôt tried Apple maps in a long time, try it again, Waze is getting better every day it has gave an accurate cops ahead alert several times.",0.0

My biggest complaint of all about the app is the messed up street view. The street view with the blue lines is seriously broken. It‚Äôs almost unusable at this point. Some intersections have 6 blue lines running in all different directions. The intersection looks like a maze including ones the run up into the sky!

I was emailing to enquire whether we could set up a meeting to discuss how our systems could work together I.e links on your maps so the public can look around the stores, properties to buy, land for sale and for other engineering aspects I.e it would help with various permits for access to roofs etc and so people can see various bits they can see clearly which are currently on google maps. 
We are also currently in the process of creating tours at various universities and schools which our clients are really keen to do for new pupils so they know what to expect and have a quick look around the campus so it won‚Äôt be so daunting on the first day which could also I think be linked to your system.

It then only flagged my junction when I was level with it so I missed it, then the alternative route that it said had a 4 minute delay, added 30 minutes to my journey despite me only being 3 minutes from the hold-up.

Google Maps - Transit & Food,Good but some major flaws,4.53,3.0,"Generally a good navigation app and I‚Äôve used it consistently over the last four years. 

However three major areas which I‚Äôve noted as room for improvement. 

FASTER / ALTERNATIVE ROUTE- the app does not take into consideration additional distance when formulating an alternative route. For instance, the App recently tried to divert me to save 8minutes on my journey time but added an additional 35 MILES. This is not acceptable or fuel efficient. The App should make any additional distance clear when offering the alternative route. 

COMPLICATED/ DELAYED INSTRUCTIONS - the app sometimes can give a series of instructions in a very short space of time and sometimes these are inaccurate. The App often corrects these mistakes quickly but I believe this to be dangerous as can panic a driver. 

INDEPENDENT VOLUME CONTROLS. I listen to my music moderately loudly on road trips however when the voice instructions come in over the music, it can be deafening.",0.0

Google Maps - Transit & Food,Getting worse instead of better,4.50,2.0,"Use every day for long commute and now it never picks up and reroutes if you go off course...which I do when I hit major traffic problems that the app no longer picks up!

Google Maps - Transit & Food,Starting to annoy me,4.50,2.0,"At first I loved this app, now it‚Äôs really starting to annoy me. 
When it first decided to totally erase the addresses I had entered for home and work I thought it was a glitch, but now it seems to do it every few days so I have given up after about the 5th time of entering them. 
I am sure it‚Äôs a ploy to force me to set up a google account but guess what. 
Also, the volume not equalising with the other output and not being adjustable like iPhone maps audio is, totally annoying.
So yeah, whilst being able to change icons or add stickers are fancy functions that literally no one actually needs, the core function of a map app of storing addresses doesn‚Äôt work.

Google Maps - Transit & Food,Strengths and weaknesses,4.50,4.0,Great free Sat Nav tool if you use it that way. You can see traffic hotspots and instructions are well thought out to be clear and unambiguous. Sadly no way to alter a route slightly. Can add stopping points but Google Maps doesn‚Äôt then work out a shortcut back to your main route but makes you double back the way you came and then back to the main route. A long about ! So close to being the only map and navigation tool you need. Come on Google with a tiny bit of extra effort you could easily outclass all the other offerings free or chargeable !!!,0.0

Every now and then for 30+ years I have told them. The google map car came down Brambleside Cul de Sac and took photos of Broderick House, a block of flats like the other 6 Blocks all with numbers 1 to 6 on the name plate and made that my house. Visitors that come to see me I have to give the postcode of HP11 1LE which is a block of flats.

Google Maps - GPS Navigation,Forcing toll roads,4.47,5.0,"I‚Äôve loved google maps and been a heavy user until the latest upgrade.

The new update doesn‚Äôt save the setting and I have to ‚Äúavoid toll roads ‚Äú every time I put in directions. This normally wouldn‚Äôt have been an issue if google maps didn‚Äôt keep trying to shove the toll road route down my throat. In an hour + commute after selecting the ‚Äúavoid tolls‚Äù option google maps will still suggest it as a ‚Äúfaster alternative‚Äù to save 2-3 minutes and switch to it automatically if you don‚Äôt manually dismiss the suggestion (hard to do and not safe to while driving). Moreover I have also noticed that it will sometimes suggest the toll road option even if it‚Äôs actually a few minutes slower. Seems like a very cheap and annoying way to make money with whatever partnership google has with the toll road company.

2-Update makes it easy to compare the time it takes to get to your destination using different modes of transport (though only after you pick a mode of transport).

3-Saves your search history, so it predicts what you‚Äôre searching for as you‚Äôre typing in a previously-searched destination. It also allows you to save a destination to make it easier to search for.

4-Tells you how much it would cost to get there by Uber if you‚Äôre a user.

5-I like the thumbnail preview and reviews that show up on some places.

6-An update has added white dots on the public transport routes to indicate bus stops.

7-You can save places to make them easier to search for.

HOW TO MAKE IT BETTER: 1-When you put in a destination, show all the different travel-times for the modes of transport straight away, instead of showing just one travel-time.

2-If you type in ‚ÄúOK maps‚Äù you can save a map to your device to save on data - but you have to manually zoom in and out to find out how much you can save. It would be better if there was a rectangle that you could move around to choose what to save.

Google Maps - Transit & Food,"Mediocre Performance, Very Poor UI",4.53,2.0,"I used to like Google Maps, and always used it over other navigation software. However, recently I have tried out numerous other systems and I believe that although the actual performance is, for the most part, satisfactory, the UI is very underdeveloped compared to some other maps. Below are some features I would like to see remedied/implemented.

The compass is very inaccurate and slow to respond in comparison to other maps on the same device (which is less than half an year old). The light blue semitransparent circle around the location indicator is also annoying, and, as far as I can tell, pointless in terms of actual functionality (correct me if I‚Äôm wrong).

The map itself does not contain information about where the safety cameras are. Future implementation would be helpful, including voice and visual warnings about camera location and type.

Voice and visual guides as to which lanes to be on at all rather complicated junctions would be good, as well as getting ready for upcoming turns. This is already partly implemented but not very detailed. If possible, take advantage of Google Street View and indicate which lanes to be on using images from that. I found that, when I went to the complex roadways of China, Baidu Maps (which had this function) helped me more than Google Maps even though I couldn‚Äôt understand the audio.

Voice and visual indications on upcoming moderate and heavy traffic including distance of effect and estimated time to pass. Also slightly increase the predicted time of passing, as it currently underestimates a little.

Take into account how you normally can‚Äôt drive up to the speed limit as well as adding in estimated delays for red lights. On Gasman OS, it does this and, in my experience, ends up predicting the trip time accurate to two minutes on almost every occasion.

There are also some other little things that Baidu, Apple and other maps have that would be easy to implement and yet greatly improve customer experience - just take a look for yourself. Needless to say, Google Maps is still very good to use in certain scenarios, but for now, I‚Äôve stopped using Google Maps but I hope to come back to it in the future in light of new updates.",0.0

Google Maps - Transit & Food,After using everyday for a month...,4.50,3.0,"There are a few things that drive us crazy. 

1. When carefully using your fingers to look around it will just scoot 100km in one direction, forcing you to centre view and start again. 

2. You can‚Äôt EASILY change from maps to satellite WHEN in a navigation. The layers option disappears behind a more complex settings menu. Using satellite maps as a co-driver can be important in foreign countries to determine wether it‚Äôs a bridge or a ferry. Or generally provide more useful data when exploring foreign/remote areas. 

3. Road closed. We navigated 5 hours south in Norway, to find a road closed sign and have to drive 3 hours north to begin the detour. Had we used Waze/Apple maps, we would have known in advance. (Had been closed for 5 months...) 

4. When you manually start manipulating the map to look around, you click on put north up, you will find yourself fighting the auto rotate or zoom. Arghh.

Changes to the app that weren‚Äôt required and are now annoying: 
- instead of showing my home and work addresses on the home screen, it now lists restaurants etc that I don‚Äôt care about. I use it to check traffic for my commute not go out, I now have added steps every time I use the app
- no longer shows other routes, just tollways. I live 60-90 mins from work. I want to know the quickest way not the most expensive. 
- the arrow no longer knows which way is up and the blue dot is broken/missing. It used to take a minute to orientate itself but now I work it quicker than my phone. 
- Also annoying is the now convoluted start sequence. You‚Äôve made it more complex than it was. Not useful when driving, more of a distraction.

But now the worse experience is on iPhone X, since none of the features work on a lock screen. It doesn‚Äôt show automatically, in a turn on lock screen. Also on iPhone X even though the maps app is prioritised, when I lock my phone, the maps will not show when I just press power button (just like when you simply want to check time, you just press power button, or actually advance phones just need a glimpse, no need to unlock phone) I have to unlock my phone to view maps. The only option is keep phone unlocked, which drains my battery. 

Please change this, like it used to be on iPhone 4, where when the phone is on lock screen, Google Maps would automatically illuminate the screen for turns on ongoing maps, so we don‚Äôt have to touch the phone at all when we drive. 

Also please try to include speed limits, just like usual old GPS systems. 

Thanks heaps for the support till now...!! üôÇ",0.0

Nothing is more usable, obvious, or intuitive than an arrow pointing in the direction you‚Äôre facing. Nothing.

We had a booking for the kids to meet Santa at 1:30pm we would have been just on time if not for the absolutely absurd directions. We end up being 25 minutes late. Now I understand that Google maps directions are not always perfect but this was absolutely ridiculous!!! I learnt a valuable lesson tho --- DONT COUNT ON GOOGLE MAPS TO GET YOU WHERE YOU NEED TO GO.  Check the route with at least one other maps app (or better yet a real map) before heading on your journey.

Thankfully Apple recognizes this and allows users to turn off this Apple system level notifications. I did that for messenger when I first installed it.

Messenger,Facebook messenger need to pickup the pace,179.0,3.0,"Facebook messenger is seriously lacking behind with simple and small functions that can make it great. 
Facebook has friends that we do not want to share our phone numbers with to be able to communicate on other great and easy to converse instant messaging apps. 
One of those function is to be able to reply directly to a particular message. 
So difficult to handle conversation on Facebook as it doesn‚Äôt allow for different topics to be discussed concurrently just with a reply functionality. 
Most times when you go back to an old discussion during a new one the whole thing becomes confusing and then takes longer to type and clarify things with who you are chatting with. 
I can have a discussion in 3 mins on other apps and that same conversation would take me 10 mins on Facebook messenger. 
This is because you talk about one topic finish it up properly and start the next one again.
When you can talk about both same time just directly replying to the exact thing you getting back at.

Since Facebook decided to implement the ‚ÄúM‚Äù suggestion function, it is impossible to get rid of it. After some research, I read that this function can‚Äôt be turned off. In their help db they show a ‚ÄúM Setting‚Äù with the option for the user to turn it off or on (by default it is on). Well, this preference doesn‚Äôt exist. This function is an AI module that learn about you and ‚Äúpropose some suggestions‚Äù when in conversation, but it looks more like another forced way to collect user data. This totally disgust me so: another star lost.

Rendue presque inutilisable. D√©marrage de l‚Äôapp prend presque 1 min de page blanche.

It becomes more and more unusable. Slow startup takes about 1 min on a blank page before available. Erratic keyboard inputs (you write and it stops, then letters are spitted in bunches), very irritating! Interface is more and more heavy with candy-gadget aspect (hey! It‚Äôs a text app!!!).

Messenger,"Utter garbage once efficient, now barely functioning",144.0,1.0,"I've been using the app for many years and it used to be a perfectly fine messaging app that would inform you precisely when the person was online, the notifications would show up the second something happened and the texts would send quickly and efficiently.

Along the line since then the app has undergone several 'updates' that were supposed to improve it though I can safely say it has done anything but. It's been devolved so harshly that now it's a regular occurrence to not receive a notification unless you go into the app itself and suddenly it will show you've received a text like an hour ago but you'd never have been told that, everything takes far too long to send, for example I was trying to send a text that was quite urgent otherwise I'd miss my train. It was a two line small text and it's been over an hour since I sent it and it still hasn't reached the person I was texting (evident by the little circle at the bottom still being an outline instead of being coloured in), in fact it still hasn't been sent as of me writing this! And don't get me started on the bloody video chat feature, Skype is a better option by far, here it's not out of the ordinary for the app to crash and freeze, yes freeze, your phone in a black screen forcing you to reboot the whole device.

I'd gladly move to a different app had I not all my friends and other contacts on this app with mountains and mountains of old, sentimental, and important texts from back when the app was far more than passable. Currently this app is fantastically bad and I 100% urge you not to use it lest you end up like me who depends on it as their only means of communication to some people.

Messenger,Why?,147.0,1.0,"Messenger won‚Äôt open, it continues to crash. I have absolutely no way of contacting anyone on my facebook privately. I understand facebook is a free service, always trying to provide a quality and safe social networking site, BUT, was it necessary to make it that you cannot message or contact anyone via message WITHOUT having the messenger app installed? I get the point of it, but what happens when messenger crash‚Äôs and we cannot access ANY of our messages until the problem somehow fixes itself or until a new messenger update is released? For some people, including myself on occasion, we cant access our messages for 24hours IF NOT a couple of days until the problem is resolved. Thus being a moderate to decent sized issue hence absolutely no access to the messenger app. As i stated earlier, I understand Facebook is a free service, and i do appreciate the quality and design of it. But it has its flaws, 99% being minor. But the issue i just raised, I personally think is a reasonably decent flaw that makes facebook harder to use and less attractive to want to use. At the end of the day, the more people using facebook = more money for facebook right? Maybe consider trying to fix this problem, it would be beneficial for the franchise and for those who have the same issue as myself because i certainly know I‚Äôm not the only one. Other than that main issue, i cant really flaw facebook. There‚Äôs always something minor but the facebook team always manages to jump on it rather quickly and fix it. Long story short, if you could make the Facebook and the Messenger application to not need each other to access messages and send messages, that would be great. Let people decide if they want to install messenger to use it, not force them to install by not letting them access any of their messages. Cheers",0.0
